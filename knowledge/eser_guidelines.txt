B. Introduction, Motivation and Aim
The European Society of Emergency Radiology (ESER) is an apolitical, non-profit
organisation, exclusively and directly dedicated to promoting and coordinating the
scientific, philanthropic, intellectual and professional activities of Emergency
Radiology. The Society’s mission at all times is to serve the health care needs of
the general public through the support of science, teaching, research and the
quality of service in the field of Emergency Radiology [2]. One particular aim of
ESER is to advance and improve the radiologic aspects of emergent patient care
and to advance the quality of diagnosis and treatment of acutely ill or injured
patients using imaging.

Emergency Radiology encompasses medical and surgical

subspecialties

including polytrauma services. Concerning the latter, past and present ESER
board members had taken part in several interdisciplinary guideline processes.
However, the ESER board has observed the lack of dedicated separate
independent radiological recommendations for radiological polytrauma service.
The ESER has therefore created such recommendations with the hope that this
will start to bring corresponding diverse national and international radiological
societies together in order to refine the statements, gain visibility for national
socities and in particular, strenghten the role of radiology in upcoming
interdisciplinary polytrauma guideline processes.

To initiate the process, ESER decided to deliver an initial radiological European
guideline. Both data preparation and consensus finding were similar to other
European Radiology guideline developments in many aspects. However, the
ESER recognised that there would be some limitations in the coverage of the
topics, which they addressed in a variety of ways. Firstly, in cases where
statements lacked of strong scientific evidence, ESER formulated an expert
opinion according to the experience of the concensus group. The consensus
group consisted of past and present ESER Board members with a broad range of
clinical experience in both Emergency and other subspecialty branches of
Radiology, working at multiple academic and clinical institutions in at least seven
different (mainly European) countries. As ESER also wants to be a promotor of
7

future scientific work, we hope to give advice on specific questions as well as for a
more general principal direction. To update this guideline, ESER will refine the
statements at appropriate time intervals, (currently estimated to be two years).

The ESER hopes that this guideline motivates diverse national and international
radiological societies to come together in order to refine the statements over time.
The ESER acknowledges that these guidelines do not focus on the radiological
polytrauma service for children and Interventional Radiology. Rather the ESER
invites the corresponding national and international radiological (sub)societies to
contribute in the future. Where the guidelines do overlap with other radiological
communities on topics such as Musculoskeletal, Abdominal & Urogenital imaging,
the ESER anticipates arriving at a consensus in the future.

The ESER Guideline on Radiological Polytrauma Imaging and Service is
published in two versions: a full version (this document) and a short version also
covering all recommendations (open access publication in ’Insights into Imaging’
[1]). This causes text overlap between the two versions. We mention this to avoid
a potential conflict with respect to self-plagiarism.

D. Method
The ESER Board instructed the former ESER President (SW) to divide the entire
field of radiological polytrauma care into individual sections. SW assigned parts of
the project to JH as part of his doctoral thesis at the Ludwig-Maximilian-University.
Together they were responsible for preparing information for each of these
sections based on current literature and individual experience.

Each section was processed and prepared for the consensus conferences
according to a fixed schedule:

Determination of key issue(s)
Literature research
Selection of literature
Classification of literature
Rating of literature
Determining a level of evidence
Suggesting a grade of recommendation
Suggesting a statement for each key issue as basis for the consensus
conferences.

Key issues
Each section was related to one or more key issues/questions. The consensus
conference had to discuss and vote on at least one answer to each key question,
but was also allowed to delete or change answers (statemetents).

Literature research
For each key issue, a literature search was conducted with subjectively fitting
keywords from the MeSH terms (Medical Subject Headings [3]) including
subjectively fitting synonymous keywords. The MeSH term search itself was
performed using NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) [3].
These keywords were used for searching through several databases: Firstly for
guidelines, the databases of the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence [4]) and AWMF (German Association of the Scientific Medical
Societies [5], German because SW and JH were able to understand it and, if
necessary, translate it for the consensus conferences) were scanned. Secondly
10

the databases MEDLINE (via PubMed [6]), Cochrane Library (via Cochrane
Library [7]) and Embase (via Ovid [8]) were scanned. The databases were
accessed via the Database Information System (DBIS) [9] of the University Library
of the LMU Munich, where full text access was available for almost all, but not
exactly all journals. If there was only access to the abstracts but not to the full text,
the literature was excluded. Search terms and their connection were adapted to
the individual databases.

In the following, the chapters in this paper correspond to the individual sections for
which the search terms/search strings used are listed in detail there. The NICE
search for guidelines was carried out with an additional filter "Secondary
Evidence". PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched using the
"Advanced Search" function. The literature found was selected in a fixed order.
The first step was to evaluate the relevance by title, then by abstract and, if
necessary, by keyword search in the full text. This evaluation was subjective with
regard to the fulfillment of exclusion criteria (see below). Any literature not
excluded in this first step was then subject to a more detailed second step
examination of the inclusion and exclusion criteria on the basis of the full text, and
after this second step either included or excluded.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria for literature selection
The literature was selected on the basis of a catalogue of inclusion criteria. The
inclusion criteria listed here applied equally to all sections/key issues. Only
"section" and "further inclusion criteria" were specifically adapted to the key issue
and are listed in the respective sections (below I. Appendix A). Exclusion effected
in case of at least one of the inclusion criteria listed below was not fulfilled.
Inclusion criteria were:
1. Publication period from 2010 to February, 15th 2019
2. Study population: n ≥ 50, adults (an exact age limit was not drawn, since
children develop at different rates and therefore, from a radiological point of
view, there may be a smooth transition to the body of an adult.)
3. Language of publication: English or German (German because SW and JH
were able to understand it and, if necessary, translate it for the consensus
conferences)
11

4. Full text accessible, free of charge via the university environment used
5. Clinical relevance of the literature included with regard to the key issue
(subjective evaluation)
6. Additional criteria for guidelines:


It is published as a guideline, i.e. using the word ‘guideline’ in the
title



The guideline is described as being current or no updated version is
available

7. Additional criteria for studies:


Allowed

study

types:

meta-analyses,

systematic

reviews,

randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies,
cross-sectional studies, before - after studies


Outcome: p - value < 0.05 and/or confidence interval (CI) > 95%.

Classification of studies
In cases of studies, the algorithm according to Hartling et al. [10] was used to
classified the study type of the included publication (e.g. prospective cohort study,
case study, case control study, randomized controlled trial):

Figure 1. Algorithm according to Hartling et al. for the classification of study types [10].
The included study types: cross-sectional study, randomized controlled trials, case-control study,
cohort study and before - after study can be determined through answering yes/no questions using
the algorithm.

12

Rating of studies
The included studies were evaluated in terms of methodological quality using
checklists. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were evaluated using AMSTAR
2 [11], randomized controlled trials using the Cochrane method [12], and cohort or
case control studies using Newcastle - Ottawa Scale (NOS) [12]. The Cochrane
method and NOS have been performed according to the description in the Manual
of Cochrane Germany and Association of Scientific Medical Societies in Germany
(AWMF) [12] (e.g. was for the randomised controlled study the items of PICO
(population, intervention, comparator group and outcome) applied? Was the
sources of funding of the study published? [11]).

Level of Evidence of studies
For every study the level of evidence was assigned using the scheme of the
Oxford Centre for Evidence - Based Medicine in the 2011 version [13]. To
determine the level of evidence 1 - 5, the study types in the table were assigned
to one specific step. If no clear allocation to a level was possible, the level was
allocated which subjectively came closest (e.g. level 1 corresponds to systematic
review of randomized trials or level 3 corresponds to a cohort study [13]).
Table 1. Oxford Centre of Evidence scheme for awarding an evidence level [13]:

13

Grade of Recommendation (GoR)
Using the evidence levels according to the AWMF Guidance Manual [14] one out
of three possible Grades of Recommendation (GoR) was issued on each key
issue:




A = ‘should/should not’
(means: ‘certainly should/should not’)
B = ‘ought to/ought not to’ (means: ‘probably/preferably should/should not’)
0 = ‘may be considered’.

The GoR was based on the evidence level of the included studies: evidence level
1 led to a recommendation level A (strong recommendation), evidence level 2 led
to a recommendation level B (recommendation) and evidence levels 3, 4, 5 lead
to a recommendation 0 (open recommendation). For statements from guidelines,
the specific degree of recommendation was adopted from the guideline. Following
the AWMF principle [15] and in case the used scale allows to do so, the
consensus conference was able to increase or decrease the GoR by one degree
of recommendation, using the following critera below (figure 2).

Figure 2. AWMF – Principle for determining the degree of recommendation [14].
The degree of recommendation is determined on the basis of the evidence level of the included
studies. The consensus conference can accept the degree or raise or lower it by one level.

14

Good Clinical Practice Points (GPP)
If there was insufficient evidence in the literature included, the degree of
recommendation - GPP (Good Clinical Practice Points, [16]- p.27) was used. In
contrast to GoR, GPP is based purely on the consensus of the experts. The GPP
degrees of recommendation are identical to those for GoR: A = strong
recommendation, B = recommendation and 0 = open recommendation. For
differentiation purposes, the degree of recommendation was therefore marked
with GPP instead of GoR.

Consensus development at the conferences
For each key issue, a statement with a corresponding grade of recommendation
(GoR or GPP) was proposed to the consensus conference by SW and JH. This
served as a basis for the discussion during the consensus conference. Each
member of the last and current ESER Board (from 2017 until now) had exactly
one equal vote. The suggested statements and grades of recommendation as well
as the corresponding literature were sent to the participants in advance by email.

The procedure for each section (statement) was as follows:
1. Presentation of the statement(s) and GoR/GPP by SW
2. Discussion was open with the possibility of further questions, additions and
objections
3. When there seemed to be a majority on the wording, it was voted on the
statement
4. In the event of rejection, an alternative wording was development
5. It was voted on the GoR/GPP for this statement
6. In the event of rejection, a new proposal for GoR/GPP was formed by
discussion considering the rules for GoR/GPP until at least simple majority
was reached
7. The respective strength of consensus was documented for the statement
vote and GoR/GPP vote.
Each voting was performed anonymous by holding a laser pointer within a given
area, which was interpreted as ‘yes’, outside this area as ‘no’, and missing pointer
signals as abstention (did not occur). All voting results were recorded.
15

An agreement of voting was achieved by a consensus strength of more than 50 %
of the present votes. The consensus strength was graduated according to the
AWMF rules ([15]- p.40) as follows:
1. Strong (strong agreement): > 95%
2. Normal (normal agreement): > 75 – 95 %
3. Weak (weak agreement): > 50 - 75 %
4. None (no agreement): < 50 %.

16

E. Key issue – Layout example
The results section presents the results of the consensus conferences which are
structured along ten sections. Each section may split in several key issues which
are presented as in the following example. Each table also holds a collection of
‘key literature’ which corresponds to the literature included (and ESER also wants
to emphasise for interested readers). The tables are also followed by a path
through the literature classification as well as the evidence levels of the included
literature.
The layout of the results concerning each key issue was structured identically
according to the following scheme:

Literature:
The included literature is listed here. First the guidelines are stated and then the studies,
alphabetically by author. Sometimes a key issue was specified in further subdivision, if it
consisted of several parts that require different literature. In such cases, the literature is listed for
the corresponding subdivision.
Comments:
optional, depending on the consensus group's view. The most common reason was in cases
when the group thought that the discussion part needs some explanation.

The statement containes a recommendation on the respective section. This
recommendation answers the key issue based on the literature found and is
graduated

with

a

recommendation

A

=

‘should/

recommendation B = ‘ought to/ ought not to’ or open recommendation 0 = ‘may

is displayed on the side. In the case of a recommendation based on a consensus
expert opinion, GPP is used instead of GoR. In addition, the table includes the
literature used for this statement and the consensus strength determined in the
consensus vote of the statements wording (Cons. Statem.) and grade of
recommendation (Cons. Grade). This is stated as a percentage and appropriate
wording of ‘strong’, ‘normal’ or ‘weak’ agreement.
Under the section of ‘Comments’, the consensus group could express or add
further comments if they wished to have these published.

The evidence table shows how many of the included studies are assigned to the
respective evidence level in table 1 according to the ‘Key issue’. Sometimes it was
useful to specify a further subdivision, i.e. several evidence tables, if a key issue
consisted of several parts that require different literature. The graduation of the
individual statments is based on the evaluation of the previously circulated
literature in the consensus conference. Unfortunately, guidelines could not be
assigned to any level of evidence. In the assumption of a nevertheless strong
significance, these are listed separately in each evidence able.

Discussion
The discussion focuses on the included literature and describes these.

Comments:
ESER does not assign a GoR because no evidence based clear prospective definition was
found in literature. As a comment, ESER wants to recommend that the decision whether a
patient is classed as polytrauma or not, should be taken by the trauma team leader in charge (a
named person for each shift or patient). The trauma team leader has to decide in consultation
with the rest of the trauma team, mainly the leading team members of Trauma Surgery,
Anesthesiology and Radiology.
*As there are several wordings for the room where polytrauma service is done, ESER choose one
of those terms and we decided to use ‘Emergency Trauma Room’ as wording in this Guideline.
Common similar wordings are: Resuscitation Room or Shock Room.

Discussion
The polytrauma patient in the emergency department will be firstly triaged for the
severity of injury. A similiar triage will already have been done in the prehospital
setting [16, 19]. The criteria are centered on the physiological state of the patient,
the injury region and the accident mechanism. Depending on this, the emergency
response team is activated, including, if necessary, additional doctors ([16] -p.138
ff./ p.147 ff.) Hence a risk assessment of the patients injury severity is available at
the time of diagnostic imaging. Diagnostic imaging of the patient can be
conducted in various ways. The guideline S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma /
Schwerverletzten-Behandlung [16] and the authors Treskes et al. [19], Hsiao et al.
[18], Davies et al. [20], Dinh et al. [17], Babaud et al. [21] and Wurmb et al. [22]
have searched for criteria or concepts, which are reasonable for a whole-body CT
scan for polytrauma patients. This ensures that the patient receives a sufficient,
adequate and individual medical care. The concepts or criteria differ (table 2).
Aditionally, the cut-off parameters for the criteria in the studies are chosen
individually. The decision to apply a whole body computed tomography or
selective CT depends on which emergency team was activated [17, 18].
Hsiao et al. [18] have determined the need for a WBCT on the basis of a two-fold
activation protocol for trauma room care (table 2). They conclude that patients
with injuries in multiple body regions, GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) <9, fall >5 m,
full trauma team activation, motor vehicle accident and pedestrian versus vehicle
the patient will benefit from a WBCT. 32% of trauma patients with a WBCT
suffered from injuries in multiple body regions. 5,5% of the selective CT-Scan
patients suffered from injuries in multiple body regions (p< 0.001). The clinical
decision tool reached a sensitivity = 50%, specifity = 89%, positive predictive
value (PPV) = 32% und negative predictive value (NPV) = 94% for the decision to
use a WBCT and the finding of multiple body region injuries [18].
Dinh et al. [17] examined the cirteria for a full trauma room care or a “trauma
consult“ (table 2), without the obligation to conduct a WBCT. The full trauma room
care includes emergency, general surgery, radiology, anaesthesia and intensive
care. During the consulting trauma care, trauma surgery, general surgery and
radiology will be consulted. 355 patients of 1058 patients have completed the
criteria for a full trauma room activation. 19% (98) of patients with a full trauma
room activation received a WBCT. The decision to use a WBCT was 5 times more
22

likely in the full trauma room activation. The criteria of the full trauma room was
linked to severe injuries (34% vs. 8%; p< 0,01) and multiple body region injuries
(13% vs. 3%; p< 0,001). The authors conclude that the decision depends on
physiology, anatomic injuries and accident mechanisms [17].
Treskes et al. [19] found three studies for the choice of a WBCT-scan in a
systematic review: Wurmb et al. [22], Hsiao et al. [18] and Babaud et al. [21]. The
three studies respectively present an own concept for the choice to use a WBCTscan. According to Treskes et al. [19] Wurmb et al. [22] can reach a sensitivity =
96,7% and a PPV = 69,4% with their criteria (table 2). Babaud et al. [21] use Vittel
criteria (table 2). As reported by Treskes et al. [19] Babauds et al.´s study
outcome displays that the criteria: GCS < 13, penetrating trauma and colloid fluid
above 1000ml confidently capture a severe polytrauma. Treskes et al. [19] deduce
that no clear results for the inidication of a WBCT exist. Often a combination of
vital signs, accident mechanisms, clinical suspicion and medical expertise are
used. The parameters though, have a large range.
The recommendations of the S3 - guideline [16] sum up the common
denominators of the above studies and report these in a recommendation (GoR
B). Indication for a WBCT scan are as follows:




Disturbed vital signs (circulation system, breathing, consciousness)
Accident mechanism
At least two relevant injured body regions ([16]– p.301).

This recommendation is based on three studies. According to the guideline [16]
Davies et al. [20] have examined 255 patients and developed a point-score
system (table 2). With this system Davies et al. [20] reached a sensitivity = 79%
and specificity = 71%. Huber-Wagner et al., cited by the guideline [16], have
examined 78,180 patients and also developed a different point-score system
(table 2). The third described study is from Hsiao et al. [18]. Their results are
portrayed further above.
In conclusion the assessment can be made on the basis of physiology, injury
anatomy, accident mechanism [16-19] and high-risk patients such as elderly,
pregnant, anticoagulation and comorbidity [17-19]. Clinical expertise also plays an
important role [19]. The criteria and cut-off values should be evaluated further [18,
19].

Discussion
The guideline S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma / Schwerverletzten-Behandlung ([16]p.301) makes a GoR B recommendation for the localization of the computer
27

tomograph, which should be in or possibly close to the Emergency Trauma Room.
The guideline of the “The Royal College of Radiologists“ [23] agreed with this
statement. The College additionnally recommend, that otherwise a computer
tomograph should be built close to the emergency room.
Huber-Wagner et al. [25] formed three groups in a study with 8004 patients with
ISS (Injury Severity Score) mean = 28,6 ± 11,8. In group 1 the computer
tomograph was located in the emergency room, in group 2 it was located ≤ 50
meters and in group 3 > 50 meter away from the emergency room. The time to the
CT-scan was up to 10 minutes shorter (Group 1 = 17,1 ± 12,3 minutes; group 2 =
22,7 ± 15,5 minutes; group 3 = 27,7 ± 17,1; p= 0,001) [25].
The time to the CT-Scan was up to 13 minutes shorter (95% CI: 10,05–15,44; p<
0.001) in a randomised controlled study from Saltzherr et al. [27]. They compared
the highest level of care of 1045 patients (mean ISS = 6) in two hospitals in the
Netherlands. One computer tomograph was located in the emergency room and
the other one in the radiological department. The patient was transported to the
selective CT-scan after ultrasonography and conventional radiography [27].
Retrospectively, Kinoshita et al. [26] examined a new “interventional radiology
(IVR)-computed tomography (CT) system“ ([26]- p.1) (IVR CT system), with 696
patients in the emergency room. It improved the time taken to the CT-scan up to
15 minute (p< 0,0001) [26].

The influence of the location of the computer tomograph on the morbidity varies in
each study.
Huber-Wagner et al. [25] measured in an investigation the mortality on the basis
of the standardised mortality ratio (SMR). Significant differences were found in
group 1 compared to group 3 (p= 0.016) and in group 1 and group 2 compared to
group 3 (p= 0.046). They concluded: “The closer the CT is located to the trauma
room, the better the probability of survival. Distances of more than 50 m had a
significant negative effect on the outcome.“ ([25]- p.1).
Kinoshita et al. [26] present a lower 28-days mortality by using IVR CT system for
the diagnostic and therapy (matched OR (Odds Ratio) 0,50 (0.29-0.85); CI: 95%;
P= 0.011).
The results from Saltzherr et al. [27] do not show an improvement of the mortality
rate. The mortality was measured in days until repeated introduction at the
28

hospital, rehabiliation clinic or retirement home. The maximal reachable score is
365 days. A score of 360 days for the group of the CT-scan in the Emergency
Trauma Room and 362 days for the group with the CT-scan in the radiological
department did not lead to a significant difference (95% CI: 0.13-3.5; p= 0.068).
No significant difference was found in the subgroup analysis of the 265
polytrauma patients (mean ISS = 23) [27].

The CT is built as a "dual-room sliding gantry CT" ([24]- p.1) in some clinics. The
gantry moves on two tracks between two bordering, inverse build examination
rooms. The rooms are separated by a retractable wall [24, 27]. This allows a
steady workflow in the emergency department, because the CT can be used for
another patient in the inversed room, while the other emergency room is occupied
[24].
Frellesen et al. [24] investigated the effect of the sliding gantry-method in a
retrospective study. Firstly, the time taken starting from the arrival of the patient
up to the start of CT-scan was measured. 61 patients were included. The first
group (ISS = 5) was scanned a computer tomograph, adjacently to the shock
room. The second group (ISS = 9) was scanned using a "dual-room sliding gantry
CT" ([24]- p.1). The use of the Sliding Gantry CT generated a siginifcant time
reduction of 6 minutes (21 minutes vs. 15 minutes, p< 0.001).
Secondly, the scan rates of the Sliding Gantries (Somatom Defintion AS) were
compared for 5 days to two computer tomographs (Somatom Definition AS and
Somatom Definition Flash) located in separate examination rooms. Each room
held the same number of staff. Using the Sliding Gantry 252 patients were
scanned and the two computer tomographs were used to scan 250 patients.
Frellesen et al. [24] confirm the consistent workflow in the emergency department,
with a contstant availability of the computer tomograph for further patients and the
possibility of scanning the same amount of patients with a computer tomograph
instead of two seperate units [24].

The patient has to be transported to Intensive Care/Therapy Unit, IR or operation
room after the diagnostic scan. Thus, the routes to e.g. the emergency operation
unit or interventional radiography shall be chosen with caution.

29

Kinoshita et al. [26] have found the possibility of performing: "Damage control
surgery, TAE, and a burr hole craniostomy" ([26]- p.2) using their IVR CT system.
Kinoshita et al. [26] noticed a shortening of time until the emergency operation (68
(51 - 85) min. vs. 47 (37 - 57) min.; p< 0,0001). This could, in combination with the
“dual-room sliding gantry CT“ ([24]- p.1), create a possibility of treating polytrauma
patients in the emergency room while having a second room available for
diagnosing other patients using a computer tomograph [24]. There is no safe
evidence for this, especially with regards to mass casualty incident.

Discussion
In the setting of the emergency department the multislice-spirale CT is nowadays
established [16, 28-34]. These possess between 4- and 320- slice CT [30, 34].
Such scanners should at least offer four simultaneous slices per rotation [16, 28].
However, nowadays computer tomographs with 64-slices and more are used in
trauma centres of the highest medical care [29-33]. From 16-slices onwards the
possibility of primary slice thickness below 1 mm thickness and thus isotropic
scanning exists [28].
The current technology is constantly developing to reduce the radiation exposure
during at least constant, stable image quality e.g. through iterative reconstruction
[16, 28, 29, 31, 32] or tube current modulation [28, 30, 32]. The scanner should be
compatible with these techniques.
The iterative reconstruction techniques can reduce radiation exposure significantly
[16, 28, 30]. Through this the effective dose can be reduced, depending on
constitution occasionnally under 10 mSv for a WBCT scan [16, 29, 31].
Kahn et al. [31] have compared two groups in a randomised controlled study (ISS
≥ 16). Group 1 (n = 64) was scanned using an “adaptive statistical iterative
reconstruction (ASIR)" ([31]- p.363) up to 40% and group 2 (n = 58) was scanned
with following image reconstruction using filtered back projection. The tube current
was the same for both groups. The radiation dose was 23% lower in group 1. The
32

image quality in both groups, measured by two radiologists using SNR (Signal-tonoise), CNR (Contrast-to-noise ratio) and the 5 point Likert Scale did not show a
significant difference. The effective dose reached 12,7 mSv in group 1 and 16,6
mSv in group 2 (p< 0,001) [31].
Kahn et al. [32] combined 20 - 50% iterative reconstruction with a relative reduced
tube current from 140 kV to 120 kV in a second retrospective study. They were
able to show that in three groups with a total of 61 patients (mean ISS varied in
group 1 = 9; group 2 = 6,5; group 3 = 4) that a significant dose reduction of 40%
could be reached (DLP (Dose length product): 1087 vs. 648 mGy*cm) [32].
Alagic et al. [29] displayed, by involving 219 patients, that the iterative
reconstruction (ASiR-V), using a 258 slice MSCT-Scanner (Revolution TM, GE
Healthcare), has a lower mean DLP (1681 ± 183 mGy*cm) than the 64 MSCTScanner (LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare) without iterativ reconstruction (mean
DLP: 1932 ± 247 mGy*cm; p< 0,001). The effective dose reached 11,5 ± 1,5 mSv
using the 258 MSCT scanner and 11,8 ± 3,1 mSv using the 64 MSCT scanner
[29].

Several studies have addressed the question of whether Dual-Source-CT (DSCT)
could be an alternative to MSCT for polytrauma patients [16, 35]. The short
examination time [16, 35, 36], improved differentiation of tissue using two different
X-ray spectra [35, 36], perfusion imaging [16] and the possibility of "virtual
noncontrast (VNC) images" ([35]- p.395), for which no previous imaging without
contrast media has to be conducted, [35, 36] make DSCT interesting. The use of
iterative reconstruction and low tube currents (70 - 100 kV) [16, 35] allow the
reduction of the radiation exposure, which arise through the use of double x-ray
systems [36].
Having said this, Aran, S., K.W. Shaqdan, and H.H. Abujudeh [35] state that the
image quality is worse during the same radiation dose. Additionally the images
possess a temporal and spatial offset [36].
Further studies concerning the Dual Energy CT Scanner in the emergency setup
have to be conducted, especially in regard to the radiation dose, image quality
and the profit of the work process.

33

The CT should maintain the technical possibilities for CT-angiography, reduction
of radiation exposure, and additionally for hospitals of the highest medical care,
perfusion imaging and coronary angiography shall be feasible.

Discussion
Most hospitals manage their radiological information with the programs "Picture
Archiving and Communication System" (PACS) and “Radiology Information
System“ (RIS) [38, 39, 41, 42]. Ideally, RIS ensures that radiologists have access
to patient history, laboratory values and previous findings through a suitable
connection to the “Hospital Information System“ (HIS) in order to increase the
quality of the reported findings [38].
It takes some time until the CT images are uploaded to the PACS and the first
images can be assessed. This time delay can be accelerated by an independent
"3D workstation" connected to the CT control console [43-46]. Fellner et al. state
that the volume data sets can be viewed quickly and easily in any slice thickness
and reconstruction mode ("volume image reading, VIR") ([43]- p.875). Körner et
al. [45] have used the VIR to divide the view of CT images on two screens in such
a way that axial soft tissue and bone windows, a sagittal window and a coronal
window point to two of the four windows of the first monitor. The second monitor
displays, for example, a volume-rendering technique reconstruction. The layouts
for head, thorax, abdomen and pelvis can be selected from a menu on the left
(hanging protocols). Only thin axial layers on the CT with the preset field-of-view
are calculated and sent to this station without the intervention of the MTRA
(radiographer). The reformations are automatically calculated from these thin
layers and can therefore be viewed very quickly on the workstation without any
further work from the MTRA or uploading to the PACS [45]. The first images can
be viewed before the entire CT scan is completed or the images have been
uploaded to the PACS [45, 46]. For optimal images to be available on PACS
workstations, the MTRA must perform the reconstructions manually and upload
them to PACS [45]. Mueck et al. [37] and Körner et al. [45] found that the VIR
shortens the first image view from 7.85 minutes to 4.1 minutes and from 9 minutes
to 5.85 minutes [44, 45]. However, this has yet to be confirmed in further studies
[45].
Crönlein et al. [40] also investigate software for the automatic reconstruction of
whole-body CT scans in polytrauma patients. The "Trauma Viewer, TV" also
allows to divide the screen into several windows. The CT images are displayed in
the axial plane of the head, as well as the axial, sagittal and coronal planes of the

36

spine, pelvis, thorax and abdomen. Thorax and abdomen can also be displayed in
3D reconstructions.

Thorax and abdomen can also be displayed in 3D reconstructions. On the left
side, specific body regions can be selected in a bar and can also be viewed
simultaneously. These are then displayed from right to left in axial, coronal,
sagittal and 3D reconstructions, if available. It is also possible to vary the number
of windows.
In the study by Crönlein et al. [40] 30 CT scans were independently evaluated by
two physicians using TV and a conventional CT console. The time taken from
uploading the images to diagnosis was measured. On the conventional CT
consoles, the CT images are evaluated 1.15 minutes faster on average.
According to Crönlein et al. [40] the doctors were unacquainted with evaluating
the images with the TV. However, the TV offers a clearer arrangement and
selection of all body regions. Doctors from disciplines other than radiology can
thus better evaluate the CT images [40].
Conforming to Crönlein et al. [40] however, further studies must follow in which
special attention is paid to the uploading of the images. Thus, the time to
diagnosis may be further shortened [40].
Overall, there is not enough evidence to make a recommendation for the
arrangement of the CT images on the screen. Every hospital should consider in
advance how to ensure that simple operation and an orderly, quick overview are
possible. This should also be considered for physicians who are not radiologists
[40].
Opinions on the reconstruction of CT images differ in the individual studies. The
reconstruction and reformation thicknesses vary between 1.25 mm and 5 mm [23,
43-46]. It should be noted that smaller layer thicknesses lead to a larger number
of images, which take longer to transfer [43]. The studies also differed in the
selection of the layers. Thus, the images are usually always evaluated in axial,
coronal, sagittal, and 3D reconstruction and in several suitable windows [23, 4346].
In addition, Linsenmaier et al. [46] distinguish the primary evaluation, which
should only be axial in 3- 5 mm layers in order to exclude life-threatening injuries
in advance. Afterwards, the reconstructions in other planes are evaluated.
37

The guideline S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma / Schwerverletzten-Behandlung ([16]p.180) quotes four studies (Linsenmaier et al.; Novelline et al.; Poletti et al.;
Rieger et al.) which indicate that it should be determined in advance in which
windows and slice thicknesses the images should be evaluated. In this way a time
reduction can be achieved.
An automatic artificial evaluation of the CT images would be a further support for
the radiologist. For some other clinical pictures such a help is already available.
However, these evaluations would have to be checked by a physician [38].
After the evaluation of the initial findings, a network for the exchange of
information or communication between the individual disciplines should be clearly
defined and structured [39]. Thus fast communication between the disciplines is
made possible and required disciplines can be consulted quickly [38]. In the case
of active bleeding in the form of a contrast medium extravasation, the immediate
transfer of information to the interventional radiology and shock room team leader
is required. These can decide the further procedure: endovascular intervention,
open surgical procedure, both procedures or conventional procedure. The
decision should be based on a fixed algorithm [23]. In case of possible contrast
medium extravasation, interventional radiology should be consulted [23]. Direct
communication of results of the initial examination is mandatory [38, 39]. The oral
report can be substantiated by pictures of the most important sections [44, 45] or
a transportable electronic format, e.g. via iPad [42]. Tewes et al. [42] compared an
evaluation of CT images on an iPad 3 with image viewing (Visage Ease, Visage
Imaging GmbH, Berlin) with a 3D PACS workstation (Visage 7.1, Visage Imaging,
Berlin). Three radiologists evaluated 40 CCT scans each with regard to infarcts
and CT angiography scans of the lung with regard to pulmonary embolism
subjectively using a 5 - score Likert scale. He study showed no significant
difference (p> 0.05) in the evaluation of the CT images. The radiologists assess
the operation of the iPad as unusual and difficult. The screen of the iPad was also
classified as too little for the sole evaluation [42]. Furthermore, hygiene
regulations and an improvement of the workflow must be examined [42].
However, media such as the iPad can be a possible communication aid in the
future.

38

The written report of the results of the CT examination should be marked with an
urgency level [39]. The PeerVue software, integrated in PACS, is used for this
purpose in Ireland. This supports the communication exchange between the
individual disciplines and an urgency level can be added. Each contact is
confirmed from the other side [37].
When patients are transferred between hospitals, the images of studies that have
already been performed may not be available, and the examinations therefore
have to be repeaed, resulting in increased radiation exposure for the patient. It
should therefore be possible to exchange CT images between hospitals. In a
retrospective study, Sheppard et al. [41] examined further patients (n = 1476) in
the USA for three years. The first hospital (n = 853) and the second hospital (n =
623) were compared. After the first year, the software "Trauma image repository
(TIR)" ([41]- p.275), compatible with PACS, was introduced in the first hospital.
This allows the CT images to be transferred from the hospital to the hospital in
which they were transferred. With this software, the number of repeated CT scans
can be reduced by 22%. In the first year, 11.5% ± 2.8 of patients were rescanned.
In the following two years, the number decreased to 10.1% ± 3.4 and 9.0% ± 2.2.
However, in the second hospital the number of double-scanned patients
increased from 16.3% ± 7.5 to 16.2% ± 2.4 (CI: 95%; p= 0.02) and 17.8% ± 3.4
(CI: 95%; p= 0.02) [41].
IT support should be provided for devices and software at all times [39, 44].

Literature:
No literature search was conducted
Comments:
Quality management has long been established in industry and is increasingly proving itself in
medical applications. Quality management is desirable, but so far little suitable reliable
information is available. More precise recommendation on quality management should be the
subject of future research and also of radiological or clinical consensus conferences. As a first
choice useful parameters may be: time-to CT-service; time of CT-service; time-to therapy; total
dose; image quality; errors in first, second and third readings; number and frequency of
morbidity and mortality conferences.

Discussion
Quality management is not covered here as in the other points. However, it is
undoubtedly an important and comprehensive topic. In general, it serves to check
and continuously improve standards. However, there is no concrete concept with
clearly defined criteria for the measurement and control of emergency radiology.
The guideline S3 - Leitlinie Polytrauma / Schwerverletzten-Behandlung ([16]p.22) uses several measured values as quality indicators in preclinical care, shock
room care and for overall evaluation. In the case of shock room supply, the
following times are measured and evaluated:




from the admission in the hospital to the x-ray of the thorax (patient: ISS≥
16)
from hospital admission to eFAST (patients: ISS≥ 16)
up to CT scan in case of preclinically unconscious patients (GCS≤ 8)
40





up to a full body tomography scan
until the end of diagnostics (patient: ISS≥ 16)
until the end of the diagnosis, if it could not be completed for emergency
reasons (patient: ISS≥ 16).

For the overall evaluation of emergency care in patients with a ISS≥ 16 the SMR
is calculated using the RISC (Revised Injury Severity Classification) and the
TRISS (Trauma and Injury Severity Score) [16]. Other studies are starting to
suggest further indicators [44, 47].
Furthermore a separate consensus conference should be dedicated to the
determination of quality management in emergency radiology.

mortality. Such findings in unstable patients may be tension pneumothorax, pericardial
tamponade, massive bleeding in the pleural or peritoneal spaces.

Discussion
The "focused assessment with sonography for trauma" (FAST) or the "extended
focused assessment with sonography for trauma" (eFAST), supplemented by the
examination of the pleura and the pericardial sac, should be part of the primary
survey. It serves as the first imaging of the patient [8, 41-44, 46, 47, 49]. The
examination can be performed in stable and unstable patients [43, 46, 51]. The
examination has a low sensitivity, but high specificity [41, 43-46, 48-50].
Thus, important injuries or non-specific findings cannot be excluded with sufficient
certainty and further diagnostics should follow [16, 48, 50, 56]. If the result is
positive, an immediate therapeutic measure should be taken if necessary [16, 50,
51, 56, 57]. In almost all cases the FAST or eFAST therefore does not serve as
definitive decision making tool for further imaging, e.g. for the indication of
computed tomography scans [16, 48, 56]. If a computed tomography scanner is
not available, the sonography should be repeated [16, 56]. FAST or eFAST can
be performed quickly [16, 50, 51, 56] and should not cause CT scan delay [23,
51].
The guideline S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma / Schwerverletzten-Behandlung [16] has
formulated several recommendations for FAST and eFAST. First, an eFAST
should be performed as part of the Primary Survey in the case of abdominal injury
([16]- p.298). This has received a level B recommendation. Secondly, a
pneumothorax or haematothorax with the eFAST should be excluded ([16]p.158). The degree of recommendation is B. However, another recommendation
recommends that the eFAST should only be performed in the context of chest
trauma if a chest CT with contrast agent is not available ([16]- p.158). The degree
of recommendation is also B in this case. In haemodynamically unstable patients
with thoracic trauma, the diagnosis of a pericardial tamponade should be part of
the eFAST ([16]- p.165). This recommendation is based on the consensus of
experts. According to the consensus expert opinion of the guideline S3 – Leitlinie
Polytrauma / Schwerverletzten-Behandlung, the eFAST can be used to search for
the cause of cardiovascular arrest ([16]- p.256). If a computer tomograph is not
available, the sonography should be repeated ([16]- p.175). A recommendation
level B is assigned for this.

43

The American College of Emergency Physicians [50] recommends that
haemodynamically unstable patients with an abdominal injury benefit from a FAST
scan to decide on an emergency laparotomy. It cites six authors with a total of
1800 patients who found a sensitivity of 79% to 94% and a specificity of 98% to
100%. A recommendation level B was designated [50].
A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was conducted by Stengel et
al. [56]. They included 4 studies examining ultrasound for blunt abdominal injuries
in the emergency room. With a total of 1254 patients included, no difference in
mortality with or without FAST can be observed. However, patients had a 60%
lower relative risk of delayed diagnosis of intraabdominal injury. In addition,
Stengel et al. [56] established that the number of CT scans with a previous FAST
decreased by 50%.
Zieleskiewicz et al. [57] present a study with 756 patients. They investigated the
initial imaging in the emergency room and its therapeutic measures. The eFAST
can lead to immediate chest decompression, chest drainage, thoracotomy,
pericardial drainage or laparotomy. Sonography of the lung showed a sensitivity =
69%, specificity = 99%, positive predictive value = 94% and negative predictive
value = 95% for pneumothorax, and sensitivity = 48%, specificity = 100%, positive
predictive value = 90% and negative predictive value = 97% for hematothorax.
They found a sensitivity = 70%, specificity = 96%, positive predictive value = 78%
and negative predictive value = 95% for intraabdominal fluid [57].
Ojaghi Haghighi et al. [54] conducted a study with 163 patients. They compared
the sensitivity and specificity of pneumothorax and hematothorax diagnostics
between ultrasound, X-ray and CT scan. Of the patients included, 24
hematothoraces, 29 pneumothoraces and 23 hematopneumothoraces were
diagnosed. In pneumothorax diagnostics, sonography achieved sensitivity =
96.15%, specificity = 100%, positive predictive value = 100% and negative
predictive value = 98%. Hematothorax diagnostics resulted in a sensitivity =
82.97%, specificity = 98.05%, positive predictive value = 95.12% and negative
predictive value = 92.66% [54].
Sauter et al. [55] described the characteristics and location of the diagnosed
pneumothorax in a retrospective study with 109 patients. The eFAST achieved a
sensitivity of 59%. The overlooked pneumothoraces were more basal (p = 0.05),
apical (p = 0.01) and significantly smaller (left: 30.7 vs. 12.1 mm, right: 30.2 vs.
44

6.9 mm; p< 0.001). In addition, 88.9% of injuries diagnosed with eFAST required a
therapeutic measure and only 30.2% of pneumothoraces overlooked with eFAST
require a therapeutic measure [55].
Abdulrahman et al. [51] demonstrated sensitivity = 42.7%, specificity = 98.1%,
positive predictive value = 76.2% and negative predictive value = 92.4% of
pneumothorax from eFAST. The study was performed prospectively with 305
patients.
Akoglu et al. [52] conducted a prospective study. They included 140 patients. The
eFAST achieved sensitivity = 42.9% and specificity = 98.4% for the diagnosis of
intraabdominal fluid. Moreover, Pneumothorax was detected by eFAST with
sensitivity = 75% and specificity = 99.2% [52].
In a retrospective study of blunt abdominal trauma with 3181 polytrauma patients,
Becker et al. [53] examined the FAST scan. In the diagnosis of free
intraabdominal fluid, the FAST scan achieved sensitivity = 75%, specificity = 98%,
positive predictive value = 88% and negative predictive value = 88%.

Discussion
However, the CT scan has replaced conventional X-ray in many applications and
is now often the gold standard [16, 23, 58, 61, 64].
Nevertheless, conventional x-rays continue to play an important role in the
treatment of polytrauma patients. Conventional X-rays should not lead to a delay
in imaging using whole-body CT scans [23]. In addition, it does not provide any
additional information regarding injury to the pelvis, thorax or spine [16, 23]. The
guideline S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma / Schwerverletzten-Behandlung ([16]- p.300)
addresses the possibility that serious injuries in the area of the thorax and pelvis
can be detected on the topogram. Thus, the conventional X-ray in this area can
possibly be replaced by the topogram. However, there is no reliable evidence to
date [16].
A whole-body computer tomography scan with contrast medium can currently,
under certain conditions, also be used for imaging haemodynamically unstable
patients ([16]- p.301). In addition, an eFAST should also be performed ([16]p.165). Yet, additional evidence of WBCT scan is required as the diagnostic tool
of choice for haemodynamically unstable patients.
Regardless of this, the X-ray machine should not disappear from the shock room.
It retains an important position as the second choice in imaging. Conventional Xrays serve as a replacement if, for example, the CT scan can not be performed
due to inadequate time availability or technical problems [16].
In the care of a trauma patient with selective CT scan, eFAST and X-rays play an
important role in the decision of the required scan area [59, 60, 63].
The number of conventional X-rays images of the cervical spine is significantly
reduced by the CT scan [60]. In many cases the radiographs are not evaluable or
incomplete and are repeated by CT scan [16, 59, 60, 62]. In contrast, some
literature still recommend conventional X-rays in cases of suspected cervical
spine injury alone [16, 23, 58, 62]. The inclusion criteria describe a patient whose
freedom of movement of the neck cannot be tested or is below 45 degrees [58]. In
47

the case of a more severely injured patient, a CT scan is recommended [16, 23,
58, 61, 62].
With regard to the diagnosis of thoracic injuries, conventional X-rays are not a
primary investigation. The eFAST or sonography has the same or even better
sensitivity and specificity [16, 54]. The CT scan is then considered the gold
standard [16, 61] and has reduced the number of x-rays or replaced the need for
them altogether [60]. Nonetheless, if a CT scan is not possible, an X-ray image
should be taken [16].
In the case of a pelvic injury, the recommendations still vary between X-ray and/or
CT scan ([16]- p.193) or just primary CT scan [59, 61, 64]. The x-ray is used to
check an occult fracture, hidden by pelvic stabilization. This also applies to a
previous negative CT scan [16, 64]. Here, too, the whole-body tomography scan
leads to fewer x-rays [60].
The introduction of the whole body computed tomography scan alone has not
reduced the number of x-rays of the extremities [60]. Especially in the case of sole
injury, X-rays should be taken [16, 59, 61].
In the guideline S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma / Schwerverletzten-Behandlung [16] the
conventional X-ray is addressed several times. In the diagnosis of thoracic
injuries, the CT scan with contrast medium has replaced the conventional X-ray
(GoR: B) ([16]- p.155). Conventional X-rays can be used if a CT scan is not
possible in a reasonable time (GoR: B). It is also mentioned that serious injuries
could be detected in the initial scout of the computed tomography scan. This is not
supported by any evidence ([16]- p.300). The GoR A is given in the topic of pelvic
injury, which states that regarding diagnostics, a pelvic overview image and/or a
computer tomography (CT) should be undertaken ([16]- p.193). However
elsewhere, there is the consensus recommendation that a conventional X-ray
image should be performed under the condition that no computer tomograph is
available within an adequate time interval. The initial topogram of the computer
tomograph may replace the pelvic X-ray, but there is no evidence regarding this
([16]- p.300f.). The injury to the spinal column should also be examined with a
computer tomography scan. However, an AP (anterior-posterior), lateral and a
dens view using conventional X-rays is also possible (GoR: B) ([16]- p.222). If the
conventional X-ray images are not sufficiently assessable or incomplete, a CT
scan should be performed (GoR: B). CT has a higher diagnostic value ([16]48

p.223). However, the extremities should be examined with conventional x-rays or
CT in view of the patient's condition (GoR: B) ([16]- p.233, 239, 242). The use of
conventional X-rays or CT is decided on a case-by-case basis. A recommendation
for only one of them cannot be given ([16]- p.237). In the case of
haemodynamically unstable patients, the guideline recognises a consensus of
performing a full body computed tomography scan with contrast medium. This
must be done under the condition of a well organized trauma team, with suitable
infrastructure being present ([16]- p.301). In addition, an eFAST is recommended
to exclude a pericardial tamponade (consensus recommendation level) ([16]p.165).
The British Orthopaedic Association [64] achieves consensus recommendations
on the management of pelvic fractures. The diagnostic recommendations state
that patients should receive a full-body computed tomography scan with contrast
agent after high-energy trauma. After the application of pelvic stabilization, which
often has a high metal content, a conventional x-ray is used to examine a masked
pelvic fracture. This also applies to previous negative CT scans [64].
The guideline standards of practice and guidance for trauma radiology in severely
injured patients of The Royal College of Radiologists [23] provide several
recommendations on the subject of conventional radiography. In the emergency
room, the possibility of digital radiography must be available. In addition,
conventional radiography must not delay a whole-body computed tomography
scan. However, as soon as the decision on WBCT has been made, conventional
radiography of the abdomen or pelvis does not provide any additional information.
The imaging of the extremities should be delayed until the diagnosis and therapy
of life-threatening injuries has been diagnosed. X-rays are also no longer
recommended for the clarification of the cervical spine, except where an isolated
injury is suspected [23].
The NICE guideline on Head Injury [58] also states criteria for the use of
conventional X-rays to diagnose cervical spine injury. On the one hand, the
freedom of movement of the neck cannot be tested or is below 45 degrees.
However, prerequisites for a CT scan must be fulfilled. These are: GCS < 13,
intubated patient, no technical possibility for X-rays, X-rays are abnormal or
suspected, an urgent diagnosis is present, injuries of other body regions or a

49

stable patient with focal peripheral neurological deficits, paresthesias of the upper
or lower extremities, dangerous accident mechanism or older than 64 years [58].
The study by Giannakopoulos et al. [59] is based on the collected data of the
REACT study. 1124 patients were examined in the randomized controlled trial.
Giannakopoulos et al. [59] have investigated the primary care data in the
emergency room for the number and diagnoses of imaging and radiation
exposure. Of the X-ray examinations, 25.4% showed a relevant diagnosis. X-ray
thorax shows an injury in 22.8%, X-ray pelvis in 12.2%, X-ray cervical spine in
7.9%, X-ray chest and lumbar spine in 27.8% and X-ray of the extremities in
55.5%. In 88% of the patients a FAST was performed with 10.6% positive
diagnoses. An additional CT scan was requested in 72.1%. The authors conclude
that an x-ray of the spine and pelvis can be accurately indicated by physical
examination [59].
Saltzherr et al. [62] examined 1283 patients with regard to the benefits of
conventional cervical X-ray compared to CT scanning. 717 patients were
examined initially with x-rays. Of these, 35% were not complete and 2% could not
be evaluated. Clavicles (incomplete x-ray: 68% vs. 34; p< 0.001) and rib fractures
(incomplete x-ray: 56% vs. 34%; p= 0.008) could be identified as causes in some
cases. In many cases, despite this, a CT scan had to be performed. The authors
directly recommend a CT scan in patients with clavicles and/or rib fractures [62].
Moussavi et al. [63] conducted a randomized, controlled study with the aim of
achieving an effect in routine CT chest scans. 100 haemodynamically stable
patients were included in the study. In group A the further diagnosis was decided
after a chest x-ray. In group B, a CT thorax was performed after each X-ray
thorax. 38% additional injuries were found in group B by CT scan. This reflects a
higher sensitivity of the CT scan, which led to changes 8% of the time in the
therapy plan. However, the duration of hospitalization, mortality and complication
rates were the same in both groups. The authors concluded that a CT scan is
more likely to lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment [63].
Gordic et al. [60] examined 120 patients each before and after the introduction of
the whole-body tomography scan for initial imaging. Prior to the introduction, all
patients received a conventional x-ray of the thorax, pelvis, cervical spine and
FAST. Hereafter, it was decided whether selective CT was still required. After
introduction, radiological scans of the cervical spine (no WBCT: 15% vs. WBCT:
50

0%), thoraces (no WBCT: 88.3% vs. WBCT: 13.3%) and pelvis (71.7% vs. 5.8%)
decreased significantly (p< 0.001). However, the number of scans of the upper
and lower extremities (p= 0.56; p= 0.30) remained the same. In addition, 13.3% of
the patients decided to use conventional x-ray and FAST as first imaging. Prior to
the introduction of full body tomography, 96.7% needed an additional CT scan. Of
these, the rate of WBCT was 56.9%, which was due to compressed airways,
pneumothoraces, pericardial tamponades or hemodynamic instabilities [60].
In a retrospective study, Jöres et al. compared a "full-body linear X-ray scanning"
([61]- p.1) with a 128-line CT. In 106 polytrauma patients, the X-ray showed
sensitivity = 16.7% and specificity = 100% for vertebral fractures. The sensitivity of
pelvic fractures is 44.4%, specificity = 100%, positive predictive value = 100% and
negative predictive value = 95.1% for X-ray. Spinal column injuries were detected
with sensitivity = 13.5%, specificity = 100%, positive predictive value = 100% and
negative predictive value = 68.3%. Thoracic injuries were diagnosed with
sensitivity = 50%, specificity = 97.1%, positive predictive value = 90% and
negative predictive value 79.1% by conventional X-ray. The pneumothoraces of
the 12 patients were not detected by x-ray. Of 40 fractures of the extremities, 2
were not detected by conventional X-rays. The authors conclude that most injuries
can be detected by history, clinical examination and sonography. Fractures of the
extremities can be easily detected by X-ray in addition to the CT scan [61].
Ojaghi Haghighi et al. [54] present a retrospective study with 150 patients.
Patients suspected of having injured the thorax were examined with a
conventional x-ray, sonography or eFAST and CT scan. The sensitivity and
specificity of the individual images were evaluated. A total of 29 pneumothoraxes,
24 haematothoraxes and 23 haematopneumothoraxes were diagnosed. The x-ray
diagnosed a pneumothorax with a sensitivity = 34.61%, specificity = 97.95%,
positive predictive value = 90% and negative predictive value = 73.84%. For
haematothorax, X-rays achieve sensitivity = 25.53%, specificity = 95.14%, positive
predictive value = 70.59% and negative predictive value = 73.68%. The
ultrasound was higher for both clinical pictures in all values. The authors conclude
that X-ray has a low sensitivity despite high specificity [54].

Discussion
There is no literature-based evidence for this recommendation. The patient can be
placed with his head- or feet-first on the examination couch. The guideline S3 Leitlinie Polytrauma / Schwerverletzten-Behandlung ([16]- p.180) quotes several
authors on this topic. These authors only recommend that the protocol, including
52

patient positioning, should be defined in advance. This can guarantee an
acceleration of the examination time.
When aligning the patient, several points should be weighed carefully. Firstly, the
CT scan should be initiated as quickly as possible with the least loss of time
possible. Secondly, good access to the head for diagnosis and therapy should be
ensured. Thirdly, sufficient resuscitation should be possible. Fourthly, the radiation
exposure of CT device to the medical team should be kept as low as possible.
Fifthly, the tubes and cables should lead to as few artefacts, entrapments or cable
clutter as possible. Sixthly, there should be sufficient space for working areas of
other specialties, especially when localizing the computer tomograph in the shock
room.
Most points are met by aligning the patient with feet-first. The position of the
gantry on the patient's feet provides more space and therefore improved access
to the patient's head. In addition, the anaesthetists are exposed to less radiation.
Shorter cables can be routed past the patient's head and are not in the gantry for
most examination sections. The anaesthesiologist's workstation can be stationed
at the patient's head without having to share the space with the gantry. However,
the time until the start of the CT scan takes longer because the gantry or
examination table has to travel a further distance to the starting position.

For a time-optimized protocol (e.g. in haemodynamically

For

Comments:
The positioning of the arms above the head costs time as well as coming with further drawbacks,
however it does reduce the dose for the trunk. The positioning with crossed forearms over the
abdomen distributes the hardening artifacts over the abdomen, is very fast and risk-free, easy to
fix and favours the outflow of the given intravenous contrast media. In addition, the entire upper
limb, which is often injured, is often imaged in this way.

Discussion
Several possible arm positions for the CT scan can be found in the studies. After
the CT scan of head and neck, arms can be repositioned above the head [16, 6569]. If this is not possible because there is a suspicion of an injury of the shoulder
girdle or arm or there is a risk of iatrogenic injury, only one arm may be raised [65,
69] ([16]- p.303). Otherwise there is also the possibility of positioning the arms on
the trunk [66, 68, 69] or parallal along the body [16, 65, 67-69].
The guideline S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma / Schwerverletzten-Behandlung [16] does
not offer a degree of recommendation on the subject of arm position. However,
the topic is addressed at one point (Lentz et al.; Loewenhardt et al.; HuberWagner et al.). They indicate that a reduction in radiation exposure can be
achieved by repositioning both or only one arm. Therefore, the arms can be raised
in hemodynamically stable patients, excluding unstable patients. In these cases,
the arms are positioned along the body due to time pressure ([16]- p.303).
Karlo et al. [68] retrospectively investigated three different arm positions with a
total of 150 polytrauma patients (no ISS data). In group A the arms were
repositioned above the head. In group B the arms were placed next to the trunk
and in group C next to each other, bent in the elbow, on a 15 cm high pillow over
the chest. The image quality was objectively evaluated by two radiologists using
the mean standard deviation in the liver and subjectively using a 3-point scale for
the liver, spleen, aorta, spine and lower lung sections. The objective
measurement showed a significant difference between groups A (18 ± 4 HU
(Hounsfield Units)) with B (21 ± 6 HU; p< 0.05) and A with C (20 ± 5 HU; p< 0.05).
The subjective evaluation concluded that excellent image quality is present in
42% for group A, in 2% for group B and in 10% for group C. In comparison of
image quality and artifacts, the spleen, liver, aorta and spine in group A with B (p<
0.001), A with C (p< 0.001) and the spleen, liver, aorta in group B with C (p< 0.05)
were rated better. A reduction in effective radiation dose is achieved in group A
(16.1 mSv) compared to group B (21.2 mSv; p< 0.01) or group C (21.9 mSv; p<
0.01). The scan time from the first image of the neck CT to the last image of the
pelvic CT shows no significant difference (p= 0.44) [68].
Retrospectively, Hickethier et al. [66] investigated 200 polytrauma patients (no
ISS data) in two groups. The arms were repositioned in group A above the head
and in group B bent next to each other in the elbow on a large cushion (51x23x11
55

cm). Two radiologists evaluated the image quality and artifacts with a 3-point
scale in the liver, spleen, aorta, spine, and lungs. Artefacts were 21% lower in the
aorta, 32% lower in the liver, and 22% lower in the spleen in group A. The image
quality of the spleen, liver and aorta also reached a better quality in group A than
in group B (p< 0.01). However, Hickethier et al. [66] found a significant reduction
of the required time of almost 4 minutes (p< 0.01) in group B.
Four different arm positions were retrospectively examined by Bayer et al. [65]
with respect to radiation dose and scan time. The arms were positioned in group
A (487 patients) above the head, in group B (82 patients) along the body. In group
C (90 patients) the right arm was positioned above the head and in group D (44
patients) the left arm was positioned above the head. The radiation dose showed
a significant difference between group A and B (24.69 ± 6.91 mSv vs. 19.18 ±
4.99 mSv) (p< 0.0000001). However, there was no difference between B with
groups C (23.52 ± 5.23 mSv; p= 0.211) or D (22.53 ± 5.4 mSv; p= 0.076). As a
result of the scan time, there was no significant difference between group B (7.31
± 2.53 minutes) with group A (7.30 ± 2.04 minutes; p= 0.94), group C (7.15 ± 1.43
minutes; p= 0.582) or group D (7.18 ± 1.24 minutes; p= 0.707) with group B (7.31
± 2.53 minutes) with group A (7.30 ± 2.04 minutes; p= 0.94) [65].
Loewenhardt et al. [67] investigated radiation exposure with 100 patients in a
retrospective study. They were able to achieve a reduction of the effective dose of
3.5 mSv or 16-22% by repositioning the arms above the head instead of
remaining on the abdomen [67].
Kahn et al. [69] prepared a retrospective study on image quality and overlooking
diagnoses. The arm positions were examined in 6 groups with a total of 406
patients (no ISS data). The arm positions were as follows: Group A (62 patients)
along the body, group B (34 patients) one arm along the body, group C (15
patients) both arms crossed on the upper part of the abdomen, group D (22
patients) one arm on the abdomen, group E (40 patients) both arms crossed on
the pelvis, group F (30 patients) one arm placed on the pelvis and group G (203
patients) both arms above the head. Two radiologists evaluated the image quality
of the liver, spleen, kidneys and pelvis with a 4-point scale and summarized the
result in a mean value of all organs (MAO). The result showed that the best image
quality can be achieved by placing both arms above the head (MAO = 1.03; p<
0.05). Otherwise the elevation of one arm significantly improved the CT images
56

(MAO-B = 1.89, MAO-D = 1.56, MAO-F = 1.7; p< 0.05). The image quality is
superior when the arms were positioned on the upper abdomen (MAO = 1.85)
than on the pelvis (MAO = 2.08; p= 0.029). The worst result was achieved by
positioning the arms along the body (MAO = 2.3). In group E, the evidence of
bleeding due to perihepatic fluid accumulation due to liver injury was overlooked
[69].
In summary, the radiation exposure can be significantly reduced by repositioning
the arms above the head by 3 mSv - 6 mSv [16, 65, 67, 68]. According to the
guidelinie S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma / Schwerverletzten-Behandlung [16], which
quotes Huber-Wagner et al. and Fellner et al. [43], a reduction in radiation
exposure can also be achieved by repositioning an arm above the head. Yet
Bayer et al. [65] could not confirm this. Karlo et al. [68] also found no difference in
radiation exposure between the positioning of the arms on a pillow over the chest
or along the torso.
It can be stated that the image quality of the abdominal organs is superior with
elevated arms [66, 68, 69]. According to Kahn et al. [69] the image quality with a
raised arm is still improved than with both arms below the head. Otherwise, the
arms should preferably be positioned between the lower part of the chest down to
the upper part of the abdomen, rather than along the body [68, 69] or pelvis [69].
In this fashion the artefacts can be reduced [66, 68, 69].
The literature-based results differ with regard to the time required to elevate the
arms. According to Hickethier et al. [66], the guidelinie S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma /
Schwerverletzten-Behandlung ([16]- p.303) and Loewenhard et al. [67] time can
be saved by omission. Bayer et al. [65] and Karlo et al. [68] have not found any
reduction in the time required in their studies. This is justified by using the
repositioning time for other activities [65] or that the rather slighty injured patients
comply to request to reposition the arms [68].
In further studies it should be specifically investigated whether the positioning of
the arms crossed over on the body or elevated next to each other on a pillow is
superior.

The scout(s) ought to represent the entire body.
For a dose-optimized protocol, separate topograms
should be prepared for the cranial CT (at least lateral
projection) and the rest of the body (at least anterior posterior projection). If the arms are raised, this should be
done before the body topogram is prepared.

Discussion
A CT-generated overview image of the body, the scout, is used to plan the wholebody tomography scan. Since this is produced by a standing CT tube, the image
58

quality is worse than in X-ray, but quickly available, as a primary image
information with every CT scan. In the literature, only scarce information can be
found on how to perform the scout. There is no clear recommendation regarding
the execution of the scout. Current literature only lightly touches the topic
regarding scouts. In clinical practice, various scouts are prepared for the planning
of whole-body tomography scans. Mainly, the procedure can be divided into a
one-unit or two-unit scout.
The one-unit scout shows the whole body. The scout is made in AP projection [30,
66, 72-74]. In some clinics an additional lateral projection is made for planning
[30, 66, 72]. The CT scan of the whole body is then planned and performed [30,
32, 48, 66, 70-74].
In the two-unit scout, the whole body tomography scan is divided into two scouts.
First, an overview image of the head is taken and the cranial CT is performed.
The overview image is taken in AP projection and/or lateral projection. The
second step is to create a scout of the remaining body and plan the remaining
whole-body tomography scan [23, 32, 66, 67, 74]. The scout of the body also
serves to regulate the mAs value by automatic exposure modulations (AEC),
whereby in the case of raising the arms above the head, the required radiation is
only lowered if the scout has been prepared accordingly [32, 74]. In detail, one
may only profit from dose reduction after raising the arms when the CT scout (as
the basis for calculated dose modulation) is performed after that.
Every Hospital, should consider having a fixed protocol which also includes a
scout [23].

Comments:
Virtual unenhanced CT imaging with Dual Energy techniques should undergo more scientific
evaluation. Maybe this method will allow single enhanced cranial CT scanning with sufficient
detection rates of intracranial bleedings by virtual unenhanced imaging. If so, this may have the
potential for both speeding up service and reducing the dose.

Discussion
In the studied literature a comparison between unenhanced cranial CT scan and
cranial CT scan with contrast medium can not be found. However, some studies
60

describe the whole body tomography scan protocol. Without exception, a
unenhanced cranial CT scan is performed in the protocols [16, 17, 23, 29-33, 66,
68, 69, 72, 75-77, 79-87]. Angiography of the head is sometimes additionally
required [66]. This suggests that the unenhanced cranial CT scan is accepted as
standard in the whole body tomography scan.
The guideline S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma / Schwerverletzten-Behandlung ([16]p.159) mentioned at one point that a cranial CT scan with contrast medium
complicates the diagnosis of craniocerebral trauma. Thus, the polytrauma patient
should receive an unenhanced cranial CT scan as part of the whole body
tomography scan in emergency care. This guideline recommends that in regard to
diagnosis of severely injured persons, a timely whole-body computer tomography
with a trauma-specific protocol should be undertaken. The protocol should include
an unenhanced cranial CT embedded scan in a scan from head to pelvis (GoR: A)
([16]- p.301).
The unenhanced cranial CT scan can detect intracranial bleeding [16, 31, 32, 75],
bone structure assessment, calcification and soft tissue lesions [75].
No uniform reconstruction parameters of the cranial CT scan can be observed in
the studies available. The reconstructions are calculated between 0.625 mm - 5
mm slice thickness, different body axes and windowings [32, 66, 82, 84]. The
Standards of practice and guidance for trauma radiology in severly injured
patients ([23]- p.16 ff.) presents several example protocols for the whole-body
tomography scan. Here, 5 mm axial slices are made to provide an overview of the
entire head, 1 mm axial slices from the skull, 1 mm axial slices in the bone
window and a 4-D reconstruction of the head. In the next example protocol, a 5
mm reconstruction is calculated for an overview and 1.25 mm wide slices for the
brain and bone [23].

Discussion
In the literature investigated, no clear evidence for the scan of the cervical region
or cervical spine can be found. Current findings of the whole body tomography
scans show different protocols for this region.
The first possibility is to include the cervical region in the unenhanced scan of the
head [17, 23, 33, 60, 66, 68, 78, 83-85, 88, 93, 94, 99]. Starting with the head, the
unenhanced scan area extends to the second thoracic vertebra [68, 84].
The second option is a CT examination of the neck region using intravenous
contrast medium. After the injection of the contrast medium, the neck region,
thorax, abdomen and pelvis are scanned [16, 23, 30-32, 66, 72, 76, 80, 82, 87-90,
93-95, 98, 101]. The whole body tomography scan with contrast medium starts at
least at the level of the arteriosus Willisi Circulus down to and including the pelvis
[23, 30, 80, 91, 101] or even includes the complete head [32, 82, 91]. In literature,
the scan is performed in the arterial phase [30, 66, 72, 80, 82, 87, 88, 90, 98, 101]
or arteriovenous phase by split bolus injection [23, 31, 32, 101]. The imaging of
the venous vessels also enables the diagnosis of cerebral sinus/venous
thrombosis [92, 95, 96] and, according to Kahn et al. [32], also provides an
indication of arterial dissection. In the arterial phase, further information can be
collected, e.g. on ischemic strokes and subarachnoid hemorrhage [82, 87, 92, 95,
98].
63

The guideline S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma / Schwerverletzten-Behandlung ([16]p.222f.) recommends embedding the diagnosis of the cervical spine in a wholebody tomography scan. The American College of Radiology [88] and the German
Society for Trauma Surgery e.V. [93, 94] suggest an unenhanced scan for the
diagnosis of the cervical spine. This enables a better diagnosis of cervical
vertebra fractures [16, 88] and discoligamentary injuries [16]. According to the
American College of Radiology [88], the contrast medium does not provide any
further information on cervical spine injury, but rather makes the diagnosis of fine
cervical spine fractures more difficult. However, a scan with contrast medium is
considered in case of a suspected injury of the brain supplying arteries [58, 66,
88, 91-95]. All studies with a whole-body tomography scan and imaging of the
neck with contrast medium show no inclusion of the cervical spine in the
unenhanced head CT [30-32, 72, 76, 80, 82, 87].

"blunt

87, 91-94, 97, 98, 100, 101]. BCVI occur rarely [16, 97]. In a systematic review
Franz et al. [97] were able to determine the occurrence of 0.18% - 2.7% in about
122176 patients. Schicho et al. [82] observed a mortality of 25% in 12 patients
with carotid dissection and 4 patients with vertebral dissection. BCVIs also
represent a risk factor for acute stroke [80, 87, 97, 100, 101]. BCVI should
therefore not be overlooked [16, 80, 82, 87, 100]. Grandhi et al. [98] examined the
false positive predictive value of the CT scan with regard to BCVI. The authors
came to the conclusion that the CTA delivers a high rate of false positive results =
47.4% [98]. However, CT angiography identified more clinically relevant BCVIs
[88, 98] or smaller injuries were overlooked [80, 88, 100]. Thus Grandhi et al. [98]
and the American College of Radiology [90] recommend a follow-up with a digital
subtraction angiography. This represents the gold standard [80, 87, 88, 97, 100].
Howbeit, this procedure is associated with risks, e.g. vascular injuries or apoplexy
[87, 88]. The angiography CT ultimately represents the imaging of choice [80, 88,
97, 98].
Many criteria are used to decide on screening according to BCVI´s [87, 93, 94, 97,
100, 101]. Franz et al. [97] found that cervical spine injuries (OR 5.45, 95% CI:
64

2.24 -13.27; p< 0.0001) and thoracic spine injuries (OR 1.98; 95% CI: 1.35 - 2.92;
p= 0.001) have an increased risk of BCVI. Fleck et al. [87] confirm the increased
risk of cervical spine injury (p= 0.001). Fleck et al. [87] and Franz et al. [97] did not
confirm an increased risk of BCVI with regard to a craniofacial fracture [101]. In
addition, the risk of a vascular injury increases with a fracture of the foramen
transversarium or facet joint fracture [58, 93, 94, 100]. There is a certain number
of patients who have no BCVI symptoms [87, 97, 98, 100]. In the study by Fleck et
al. [87] the rate of asymptomatic patients was 2.5%.

In the case of a penetrating neck injury, the guidelines of the American College of
Radiology [88, 90] and the Royal College of Radiologists [23] recommend CT
angiography as the imaging of choice. However, the patient may not require
immediate surgical intervention [90]. The statement, that duplex sonography is
equal to CT angiography and is also the means of choice [16], contradicts the
guideline ACR Appropriateness Criteria Penetrating Neck Injury [90].

The neck region of the whole body tomography scan is to be reformed in other
planes in order to achieve better image quality. The studies usually calculate
reformations in all three planes axial, sagittal and coronal [23, 82, 84, 87, 93, 94,
99, 101]. In addition, the CT data are reconstructed in the soft tissue and bone
kernel to ensure optimal evaluation of the cervical spine and vascular system [80,
82, 87, 89, 101]. For example the American College of Radiology [90] and Fleck
et al. [87] state that the two different kernel calculations allow the vessels and the
spinal column to be evaluated sufficiently well without extra radiation exposure.
The thickness of the layer for reconstruction of the neck region in the individual
working groups does not exceed 2 mm [66, 80, 82, 84, 87, 101]. In the
recommendations of

the Practice Parameter for the Performance and

Interpretation of Cervicocerebral Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) [91]
and Practice Parameter for the Performance of Computed Tomography (CT) of
the Extracranial Head and Neck [89] a maximum slice thickness of 3 mm is
specified for the neck. Even a maximum slice thickness of 1.5 mm is preferred
[91, 96]. The guidelines for injuries of the subaxial cervical spine [94] and injuries
of the upper cervical spine [93] recommend 1 mm slices for the reconstruction of
the cervical spine.
65

In summary, no clear conditions do yet apply to the angiography of the neck in a
full body tomography scan, which does not belong to the standard protocol [16].
However, clinics integrate CT angiography of the neck into their whole-body
tomography protocol for screening for vascular injuries [30-32, 66, 72, 76, 80, 82,
87, 88, 98, 101]. Since the whole-body tomography scan of the thorax, abdomen
and pelvis is performed with contrast medium, angiography of the neck does not
promote any additional radiation exposure [87, 88]. Otherwise, the angiography of
the neck should be included in case of clinical suspicion of a vascular injury or
relevant trauma of the head/neck region [16, 66, 91, 95], in order not to overlook
the clinically rarer but relevant injuries [16].
The American College of Radiology [88] still mentions the possibility of a full-body
tomography scan using dual-source CT. Thus, no further scans would have to be
performed without contrast medium, since the calculation of an unenhanced CT
image is possible.

Discussion
The whole-body tomography scan is performed in various protocol alternatives
with regard to a polytrauma patient. There is no agreement as to which protocol is
optimal in an emergency situation [16, 32].
The use of intravenous contrast media helps to identify and detect vascular
injuries, organ injuries and bleeding (Mirvis et al. and Peng et al., cited by
American College of Radiology [91]).
In some clinics, an unenhanced scan is built into the protocol in advance [85,
119]. However, the Royal College of Radiologists [23] is of the opinion that an
unenhanced scan of the body is of no benefit to polytrauma patients.
In most clinics, a single or double bolus injection ("split bolus") is used and the
body is presented in arterial, venous, arteriovenous or multiple phase(s) (table 4).
Single bolus allows the performance of a CT scan in a venous [66, 74], arterial
[82] or arterial and venous phase [17, 23, 30, 60, 72].
The split bolus allows arterial and venous imaging combined in a single CT scan
[23, 32, 118]. In some studies, the split bolus is also referred to as the triphasic
protocol when a saline flush is injected [85, 120].
Thus, injuries of the arterial vascular system and injuries of parenchymal organs
can be recorded in a single CT scan [32].
With the simultaneous imaging of the arterial and venous phases, another CT
scan for a second phase imaging can be avoided [31, 85, 91] and according to
Frush, cited by American College of Radiology [91], radiation exposure can be
reduced. However, two clinical protocols indicate that another venous scan of the
68

abdomen/pelvis is performed after the arteriovenous phase [80, 120]. Without a
further venous scan of the abdomen/pelvis, Yaniv et al. [85], Hakim et al. [116]
and Leung et al. [118] obtained a reduction in radiation dose. Yaniv et al. [85]
found a reduction of the effective radiation dose from 18.2 mSv (conventional
protocol) to 12.4 mSv (split bolus protocol). Hakim et al. [116] and Leung et al.
[118] achieved a reduction by half of the effective radiation dose.
The duration of the whole study by single bolus or split bolus protocol did not
show any significant difference in the study of Yaniv et al. [85] (conventional
protocol = 14.1 min vs. split bolus protocol = 14.3 min).
In the clinic protocols, the arteriovenous scan is started after 60 - 85 seconds [32,
74, 85, 116, 118, 120]. This compares to a venous scan after 54 - 85 seconds [29,
30, 65, 67, 69, 80, 85, 111, 113, 114, 120]. Thus only seconds can be saved with
a split bolus at this point. Regardless of this, Yaniv et al. [85] quotes two studies
(Nguyen et al.; Fanucci et al.) that have found a saving in examination time by
exchanging a split scan for a single-pass scan. Yaniv et al. [85] also found a
reduction in the total number of images used for CT scan evaluation (conventional
protocol = 411 vs. split bolus protocol = 317). This may cut down the time to
evaluate the whole body tomography scan. Leung et al. [118] confirmed this.
Three studies, Hakim et al. [116], Yaniv et al. [85] and Leung et al. [118]
investigated the image quality of the split bolus method in comparison to the
arterial scan of the thorax and the arterial and venous scan of the
abdomen/pelvis. Yaniv et al. [85] scanned the abdomen/pelvis only in one venous
phase. Hakim et al. [116] were able to determine an overall comparable image
quality. The parenchymal organs show a higher contrast density with the split
bolus. The vessels delivered different results. In the split bolus the contrast
density is higher in the vena portae and vena cava inferior, but lower in the
truncus pulmonalis, aorta abdominalis infrarenalis and artery iliaca communis. In
addition Hakim et al. [116] can state that a start delay of the arteriovenous scan
from 70 seconds to 60 seconds improves the presentation of the arterial vascular
system, but worsens the venous vascular system. Yaniv et al. [77] measured a
higher contrast density with the split bolus in the abdominal organs, but a lower
density in the thoracic aorta. Leung et al. [118] also measured a lower contrast
density in the abdominal aorta, but a higher density in the porta vein.

The use of a CT scan with on overlay of the arterial and venous phase has raised
concerns that active bleeding and pseudoaneurysm are more difficult to detect
and differentiate [116-118]. In the use of a separate arterial and venous phase
scan, there is a time delay between scans. This allows a progressive change in
the contrast medium, such as heavy bleeding and increased extravasation, to be
observed [117]. Leung et al. [118] cannot report any difficulties in differentiation in
5 patients with vascular injury. In two cases a delayed scan was attached to the
arteriovenous phase CT and thus a diagnosis was confirmed. The authors state
that the localization and morphology of the contrast extravasation, as well as the
contrast medium density can be distinguished between arterial and venous
bleeding [118].
Determining the optimal image quality turns out to be difficult because the image
quality also depends on the subjective component of the radiologist [85, 91]. In
the context of the practice parameter for the perfomance and interpretation of
body computed tomography angiography (CTA) [91] a contrast medium density of
at least 250 - 300 HU is recommended for arterial vascular imaging and at least
100 HU above the baseline for the venous phase. In the three studies by Hakim et
al. [116], Yaniv et al. [85] and Leung et al. [118] there is no single result which is
preferred by radiologists for the two protocol variants, the split bolus or a separate
arterial and venous scan.
In the guideline by the Royal College of Radiologists [23] both possibilities are
also indicated in example protocols. The guideline S3 - Leitlinie Polytrauma /
Schwerverletzten–Behandlung [16] does not specify a whole-body tomography
protocol. An arterial phase is indicated to quickly detect bleeding. The possibility
of a split bolus protocol is also mentioned, but no clear statement is made.

The whole body tomography scan of the body can be divided into the regions
head, neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, spine, urinary tract and extremities. The
performance of a whole-body tomography scan of the head, neck, urinary tract
and extremities is dealt with in other chapters. The CT scan of the trunk is usually
divided into the regions thorax and abdomen/pelvis. Abdomen and pelvis are
scanned together in most whole-body tomography protocols (table 4).
Some hospitals use bolus tracking to start WBCT scans with contrast agents [30,
66, 68, 72, 85, 87, 111, 112, 118]. Bolus tracking has the function of starting the
70

CT scan when a pre-set contrast density is reached in a vessel [91, 106]. The
aorta ascendens or descendens was mainly used with 90 - 120 HU in the studies
[66, 68, 112, 118]. In the other hospitals, a preset (fixed) scan delay was used.
This should be selected in consideration of the contrast medium circulation in the
vascular system [91]. In whole-body tomography protocols, 25-35 seconds were
used for arterial phase scanning [23, 29, 30, 111] and 54-85 seconds were
applied for venous phase scanning [29, 30, 65, 67, 69, 80, 85, 111, 113, 114,
120]. An arteriovenous phase was displayed after a start delay of 60 - 85 seconds
[32, 74, 85, 116, 118, 120]. In addition and if possible, an attempt can be made to
scan the patient with specific breathing instructions in the inspiration [65, 68, 106,
114]. This counteracts motion artifacts and improves 3D rendering [91].
The thorax in the WBCT protocol is mainly included in the arterial, venous or
arteriovenous phase (table 5). Naulet et al. [119] are the only ones to perform an
unenhanced scan of the thorax and abdomen/pelvis. An unenhanced scan can be
helpful for detecting and evaluating calcium deposits in the vessels [91, 104] or
extravascular bleeding [91]. According to the American College of Radiology on
the subject of blunt thoracic trauma [102] no clear evidence can be found as to
whether an unenhanced scan should be performed. Furthermore, an additional
unenhanced scan of the thorax increases the radiation dose [91].
There are 12 protocols in the included studies with the incorporation of the thorax
in a single arterial phase (table 5). An arterial phase allows the visualization of
vessels, e.g. the aorta and its outflow [108, 109] and enables rapid detection of
vascular, abominal or pelvic bleeding or dissections [16, 23]. 15 other WBCT
protocols have shown the thorax in the arterial phase combined with a venous
phase by means of split bolus (table 5). Hakim et al. [116] scanned the thorax in a
separate arterial and venous phase. In nine other clinics whole-body tomography
protocols, however, the thorax was scanned together with the abdomen/pelvis in a
venous phase (table 5). In these cases, the CT scan consisted of a single pass of
the entire trunk. The representation of the trunk in a single pass enabled the
prevention of overlapping of the scan areas, e.g. the upper abdomen. The
radiation exposure was reduced in this way [30, 74]. The Royal College of
Radiologists [23] includes the thorax in all three example protocols of a wholebody tomography scan in an arterial phase. Other guidelines also recommend an
arterial scan of the thorax [16, 28, 102, 103, 108, 109]. The scan area of the
71

thoracic region differs according to the inclusion of the neck and/or
abdomen/pelvis. With the inclusion of the neck, the scan begins at least at the
level of the Circulus arteriosus Willisi [31, 32, 69, 74, 80, 82, 87, 108, 118] and
extends to the pelvic symphysis [31, 32, 69, 74, 80, 108, 111, 118]. Without the
inclusion of the neck, the scan area of the thorax includes at least the pulmonary
apex to the base of the lung [68, 85, 106, 118]. Yaniv et al. [85] has extended the
scan area to below the kidneys and Leung et al. [118] to the pelvic symphysis.
The recommendation of the Pracitce parameter for the performance of thoracic
computed tomography (CT) [106] includes a scan from the tip of the lung to the
posterior groove between the ribs and diaphragm.
The abdomen is usually examined together with the pelvis [17, 29-32, 65, 69, 72,
85, 111, 113, 118, 119] and is treated here in the abdomen/pelvis region.
The abdomen/pelvis is scanned in 18 protocols in the venous phase (table 5). The
venous contrast phase provides information on the parenchymal organs [32, 107].
In seven other whole-body tomography protocols, the abdomen/pelvis is shown in
an arterial contrast phase followed by a second scan run in the venous phase
(table 5).
Arterial and venous imaging of the abdomen/pelvis is achieved in 15 CT protocols
with a split bolus (table 5). Laser et al. [80] scanned the abdomen/pelvis a second
time in venous phase after the arteriovenous scan of the entire trunk.
Naulet et al. [119] in addition to Yaniv et al. [85], subjected the abdomen/pelvis to
an unenhanced scan beforehand. Naulet et al. [119] conclude that an additional
unenhanced scan does not improve diagnostic confidence. However, the patient
is exposed to higher levels of radiation [119].
The guidelines recommend an arterial phase for an improved evaluation of
abdominal vessels and to better detect possible bleeding, aneurysms,
pseudoaneurysms and ruptures [16, 23, 107-109, 115].
Furlan et al. [115] were able to show in their study regarding spleen injuries that in
a follow-up CT scan with arterial and venous phase 14 of 23 spleen injuries were
only visible in the arterial scan.
The guideline S2k Leitlinie Gastrointestinale Blutung [110] recommends a multiline computed tomography scan for further diagnosis of active gastrointestinal
bleeding when endoscopy finds no source of bleeding. The CT scan of the entire
abdomen should include at least one arterial phase. Two studies (Artigas et al.;
72

Geffroy et al.) are cited, which indicate that an unenhanced, arterial and venous
protocol is recommended. However, another cited study, Dobritz et al., states that
an arterial and venous phase has the highest sensitivity [110].
In a segmented scan, the scan area of the abdomen/pelvis extends from the
diaphragm domes [68, 80, 85, 105, 111, 118, 120] to at least the included pelvic
symphysis [68, 74, 105, 118, 120].
The spinal column can be examined in the CT scans of the neck, thorax and
abdomen/pelvis. Thoracolumbar reconstructions can be calculated in several
planes and serve to clarify injuries [16, 17, 31, 32, 66-68, 82, 87, 111].
In addition to the arterial, venous and arteriovenous phases, there is also the
delayed scan. This is supplemented after several minutes in certain situations or
uncertainties [17, 23, 73, 113, 115, 117, 120]. Dinh et al. [17] have supplemented
the delayed scan if gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected. Linder et al. [73]
performed a delayed scan to examine renal excretion and Hallinan et al. [117]
performed a delayed scan in a visceral lesion, pelvic fracture or abdominopelvic
hematoma.
Reske et al. [74] suggests that the CT scan protocols should be regularly checked
and evaluated to improve them if necessary. This is to be done because
computed tomography technology is constantly being further developed.

The Royal College of Radiologists [23] provides three example WBCT scan
protocols. These are adapted to the clinical presentation of the patient. The first
example protocol is further divided into a protocol for a hemodynamically stable
and a hemodynamically unstable patient. The hemodynamically stable patient
receives an unenhanced scan of the head and cervical spine to vertebral body T1.
The CT scan is then performed with contrast medium from vertebral body C6 to
the groin. 150 ml of contrast medium with a flow rate of 3 ml/sec are injected into
the patient. The thoracic scan is performed after 25 seconds in arterial phase and
the abdominal and pelvical scan is implemented after 60 - 65 seconds in venous
phase. The thoracalolumbar spine is reconstructed in 2.5 mm sagittal and coronal
layers. In the case of a haemodynamically unstable patient, the protocol is
adapted to search for acute life-threatening injuries, bleeding or vascular trauma.
The head and cervical spine are scanned unenhanced from the vertebral body C0
to T1. The CT scan with contrast medium extends from the thorax down to and
73

including the knees. 150 ml of contrast medium with a flow rate of 3 ml/sec is
injected. An arterial scan from the vertebral body C6 to the groin is performed
after 25 seconds. After 60 - 65 seconds the abdomen/pelvis should be rescanned
in the portal venous phase. The CT scan ranges from the diaphram to the pelvic
symphysis. In the event of active bleeding or injury to solid organs, the wholebody tomography scan is supplemented by a late scan. The second example
protocol is used to search for the focus of bleeding or to differentiate between
arterial and venous bleeding. The patient receives an unenhanced scan of the
head and neck. After a 100 ml contrast medium application (flow rate: 3.5 ml/sec)
the thorax is scanned in arterial phase. The scan extends from the pulmonary
apex to the upper point of the liver. From there to ramus pubis, the
abdomen/pelvis is scanned with a delay of 70 seconds.
Another way of performing this protocol is provided by Example 3. In the third
example protocol, a split bolus is used after an unenhanced cranial CT. A 65 ml
contrast agent dose (flow rate: 2 ml/sec) is followed by an 85 ml contrast agent
dose (flow rate: 3.5 ml/sec). The CT scan starts after 60 seconds and includes the
Circulus arteriosus Willisi to pelvic symphysis.
An unenhanced scan of the trunk is not performed because, according to the
Royal College of Radiologists [23], it contains no additional information in the case
of a polytrauma patient.

Alagic et al. [29] performed a retrospective study to compare two whole-body
tomography scans. Group A, consisting of 109 patients, received a multi-phase
scan. The head and neck were scanned unenhanced from the vertex to the pelvic
symphysis in the arterial phase. The scan was concluded with a venous phase of
the abdomen. A 258-slice CT was used for this protocol. Group B, consisting of
110 patients, was scanned with a 64-slice CT. Head and neck were also scanned
unenhanced. Subsequently, the scan of the thorax and abdomen was performed
in a venous phase. The same contrast agent and the same amount were used for
both protocols. The dose-length product was siginifcantly lower in Group A (1681
± 183 mGy*cm) than in Group B (1932 ± 147 mGy*cm; p< 0.001). The calculated
effective dose was 11.5 ± 1.5 mSv for Group A and 11.8 ± 3.1 mSv for Group B.
In the brain, liver and aorta abdominalis, mean contrast density (measured in HU)
was significantly higher in group B (p< 0.001) and signal-to-noise ratio was
74

significantly lower (p< 0.001) compared to group A. In addition, the evaluation of
image quality, measured on a 4-point scale, was better in all regions for Group A
(p< 0.02). However, the required time was extended (group A: 27.8 ± 16 min,
group B: 20.8 ± 15 min; p< 0.001). Group A protocol neglected 7 out of 12 arterial
injuries (sensitivity = 67%). With the Group B protocol, 4 out of 12 arterial injuries
(sensitivity = 67%) were missed. Overlooking non-arterial injuries occurred without
significant difference. The authors conclude that the multi-phase protocol
improves image quality, radiation dose and diagnostic accuracy, unfortunately at
the cost of more time needed. Nevertheless, they will continue to use this protocol
in the clinic [29].

Hallinan et al. [117] have addressed the question of how well a CT scan with
venous phase and delayed scan detects active bleeding of the abdomen and/or
pelvis. 51 patients received a CT scan with 100 ml contrast medium (flow rate: 3
ml/sec) with a subsequent scan once after 70 seconds and second time after 5
minutes. A delayed phase was performed when the radiologist detected visceral
lesions, pelvic fractures or a hematoma. 36 patients received both CT phases and
15 patients underwent only one venous CT scan. Two blinded radiologists firstly
rated the CT images of the venous phase and then additonally to the venous
phase evaluated the results of the delayed phase. The results of a digital
subtraction angiography were used for comparison. 28 patients were identified
with an active contrast agent extravasation. Within the 36 patients who received
both scan phases, the venous phase alone achieved sensitivity = 86.4%,
specificity = 71.4%, PPV = 82.6% and NPV = 76.9% to detect active bleeding.
Both phases result in sensitivity = 95.5%, specificity = 71.4%, PPV = 84% and
NPV = 90.9%. With the delayed scan, an active contrast agent leakage was
additionally detected in 2 out of 36 patents. The delayed scan helped to
differentiate the difference between pseudoaneurysm and active bleeding in two
patients [117].

With 84 patients included, Naulet et al. [119] conducted a retrospective study to
evaluate the unenhanced scan of the abdomen/pelvis included in the whole-body
tomography scan. The whole-body tomography scan protocol consists of an
unenhanced scan of the head/neck region and thorax down to and including the
75

pelvis. An arterial scan from the base of the skull to the toes and a venous scan of
the abdomen/pelvis are then made. 140 ml (400 mg iodine/ml) were used. Two
doctors evaluated the unenhanced CT scan, the contrast CT scan and both
variants together for lesions in this region. Liver lesions, splenic lesions, kidney
lesions, intestinal-mesenteric lesions, peritoneal effusion, retroperitoneal effusion
and adrenal hematomas were evaluated. The result showed no significant
differences between the three evaluation variants in the sensitivity to detection of
lesions in the abominopelvical region. Sensitivity to liver injury (physician 1= 0.08
vs. 0.084/ physician 2= 0.16 vs. 0.96) and spleen (physician 1= 0.20 vs. 0.88/
physician 2= 0.32 vs. 0.88) were superior than unenhanced scan alone. The
same tendency is observed in the kidneys (physician 1= 0.31 vs. 0.92/ physician
2= 0.38 vs. 0.77), peritoneal effusion (physician 1= 0.54 vs. 0.96/ physician 2=
0.79 vs. 0.93) and adrenal hematoma (physician 1= 0.54 vs. 0.85/ physician 2=
0.54 vs. 0.85). In the case of retroperitional effusion and mesenteric injury there
was no difference. The specificity to all injuries was between 0.85 - 1.00 for both
physicians. The examination with an unenhanced scan showed a 20% - 25%
effect on the total effective radiation dose of the complete whole body tomography
scan. The authors concluded that the unenhanced scan of the abdomen and
pelvis does not provide additional diagnostic confidence in the detection of lesions
of the liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenal hematomas or peritoneal/retroperitoneal
fluid. The unenhanced scan should be omitted as it usually only increases the
radiation dose [119].

Hakim et al. [116] have investigated three different contrast injection protocols in
their retrospective study. 60 patients were divided into three groups and examined
with a 256-slice computer tomograph. Group A received a monophasic injection
(90 ml contrast, flow rate: 3.5 ml/sec) with an arterial phase after 30 seconds and
a portal venous phase after 70 seconds. Group B received a biphasic contrast
agent application (first: 65 ml contrast agent, flow rate: 1.5 ml/sec; second: 65 ml
contrast agent, flow rate: 3.5 ml/sec after 43 seconds) with an arteriovenous
phase after 60 seconds. Group C received the same injection protocol as group B,
but the scan was performed after 70 seconds. Two radiologists evaluated the
image quality on a 5-point scale, determined the contrast density for arterial,
venous and parenchymal areas and calculated the radiation dose. All three
76

protocols achieve good or excellent image quality. Group A (mean average rating
= 4.68) achieved the significantly best image quality compared to group B (mean
average rating = 4.28; p< 0.05) or group C (mean average rating = 4.23; p< 0.05).
Between group B and C there was no difference in subjective image quality. The
contrast density was siginificantly lower in group C than in group A in the truncus
pulmonalis (218 HU vs. 259 HU; p< 0.05), aorta infrarenalis (256 HU vs. 305 HU;
p< 0.05) and arteria iliaca communis (246 HU vs. 299 HU; p< 0.05). Contrast
density in the portal vein was significantly higher in the arteriovenous phase scan
(group A = 144 HU, group B = 191 HU; p< 0.05/ group C = 223 HU; p< 0.05). Both
kidneys (left kidney: group A = 166 HU, group B = 210 HU; p< 0.05/ group C =
209 HU; p< 0.05) and the spleen (group A = 103 HU, group B = 146 HU; p< 0.05/
group C = 165 HU; p< 0.05) achieved a significantly higher contrast density in the
arteriovenous phase scan. The liver was imaged without significant difference in
contrast density (group A = 101 HU, group B = 97 HU, group C = 113 HU). The
most effective radiation dose was lowest in group C (8.86 mSV), group B (14.84
mSv; p< 0.0001) and group A (27.75 mSv; p< 0.0001). In the clinic, a single bolus
injection with an arterial and venous phase for severely injured patients or
penetrating trauma patients now remains in use. According to the authors, it is
more difficult to detect pseudoanerysmas and active bleeding and a two-phase
protocol achieves better image quality [116].

Leung et al. [118] compared an arteriovenous phase with a multiphase scan in
their retrospective study. 73 patients were examined with a two-phase protocol
and 78 patients with a split bolus. The two-phase protocol consisted of an arterial
phase from thorax to pelvic symphysis and a venous phase from diaphragm to
pelvic symphysis with 100 ml contrast agent (flow rate: 4ml/sec). The split bolus
ranged from the Circulus arteriosus Willisi to the pelvic symphysis with a total of
150 ml contrast medium (first: 65 ml; second: 85 ml + 30 ml Saline Flush). The
scan started after 77 seconds. The contrast density in the hepatic artery was
significantly higher in the split bolus (two-phase protocol: 167.4 HU vs. split bolus:
246.1 HU; p< 0.001). Arterial contrast density of the abdominal aorta was
significantly higher in the two-phase scan (two-phase protocol = 326.2 HU vs. split
bolus = 269.8 HU; p< 0.001). The effective radiation dose was 48.6% lower in split
bolus (two-phase protocol = 10.7 mSv vs. split bolus = 5.5 mSv; p< 0.001).
77

According to the authors, it was also easier to treat the patient against acute
complications in the 77 seconds up to the start of the split bolus than in the twopart scan. In addition, the evaluation time was reduced by a lower number of CT
images. The arteriovenous scan was adopted and continued by the radiologists at
the end of the study [118].

Yaniv et al. [85] conducted a retrospective study on a new WBCT scan protocol.
42 patients received an arterial scan of the thoracic and venous phase of the
abdomen/pelvis with 90 ml contrast medium (flow rate: 4 ml/sec), followed by 30
ml saline flush (flow rate: 4 ml/sec). In the new protocol 40 patients received 80 ml
contrast agent (flow rate: 3ml/sec), after 13 seconds 50 ml contrast agent (flow
rate: 4ml/sec) and finally 30 ml saline flush (flow rate: 4ml/sec). After 75 seconds
the arteriovenous phase scan was ready. All patients received an unenhanced
scan of the head to upper abdomen in advance. The image quality, recorded on a
4-point scale by two radiologists, resulted in an improved subjective image quality
of the conventional protocol in the vessels of the aorta descendens and aorta
abdomialis above the renal outlets. However, the aorta under the renal outflows,
common iliac artery, inferior vena cava, liver and spleen have been better
evaluated with respect to the new protocol. The kidneys and the mediastinum
performed better, but not with a significant difference. In addition, the two
radiologists indicated which method they preferred. The result is divergent,
consisting of very different preferences. The mean contrast density measurement
showed a significant difference in the aorta ascendens (conventional protocol =
285 HU, new protocol = 217 HU; p< 0.001) and aorta descendens (conventional
protocol = 278.3 HU, new protocol = 213.7 HU; p< 0.002). The contrast density of
the abdominal aorta and the common iliac artery (209.2 HU vs. 127.2 HU) was
significantly higher in the new protocol (p< 0.001). The inferior vena cava
achieved a higher contrast density in the new protocol (conventional protocol =
111.5 HU, new protocol = 147.6 HU; p< 0.001). Also in the liver (109.9 HU vs.
96.2 HU), spleen (131.2 HU vs. 94.9 HU) and kidney (left kidney: 154.1 HU vs.
204.1 HU) a higher contrast density was measured with the new protocol. There
was no time difference in the required time from the whole examination of the
head to the pelvis. The effective radiation dose was 18.2 mSv in the conventional
protocol and 12.4 mSv (p= 0.0054) in the new protocol. The average number of
78

CT images in the conventional protocol was = 411 ± 39 and in the new protocol =
317 ± 33. The authors concluded that the new protocol provides a better
representation of arteries, veins and abdominal parenchymal organs. In addition,
the number of CT images to be evaluated can be reduced [85].

Discussion
Contrast agent administration is performed in most whole body tomography
protocols in a single bolus [29, 30, 65, 69, 72, 74, 82, 85, 113, 119, 123, 124] or a
split bolus [31, 32, 60, 80, 85, 87, 101, 116, 118]. In some studies the split bolus is
also referred to as the triphasic injection protocol as in the final application a
saline flush is in use [85, 120]. In both cases, the application of contrast media
should comply with the ALARA principle ("as-low-as-reasonably-achievable") and
keep radiation exposure as low as possible with sufficient image quality [91, 121].
The injection parameters should be adapted to the patient. They should be
orientated by body weight and comorbilities in order to detect an increased risk of
nephrotoxicity at an early stage [91, 121]. The whole-body tomography scan
protocols, including injection rate, scan delay, contrast agent, and flow rate, must
also be specifically adapted to the scanner [30, 91].
Preferably, a vein in the right elbow pit or on the forearm should be chosen for
injection in order to prevent artefacts [23, 60, 66, 91, 118, 120, 121].
The needle should be at least 20 gauge. This ensures the desired flow rate [23,
85, 91, 116, 125]. A contrast medium injector can help with the examination [23,
65, 85, 91, 113, 118, 125].
The contrast agent amount should contain at least 350 mg iodine/ml for a CT
angiography [91]. For a venography it should be 300 - 370 mg/ml [121].
For patients under 50kg, a contrast agent dose of 2 ml/kg may be a useful
possible match [121]. Alagic et al. [29] use an adjusted contrast agent dose of 1.1
ml/kg for the patient in the whole body tomography protocol.
Regardless of the contrast agent application used, a flow rate of 3 ml/sec is
recommended for patients over 50 kg [91]. The flow rate can be increased up to 8
ml/sec for larger patients or for shorter examination times [91].
After the contrast agent injection, a saline flush should be executed to ensure
homogeneous staining with contrast agent and to prevent contrast agent
compression in the Brachiocephalica or Subclavian artery [91, 118].
The whole body tomography protocols using a single bolus apply 90 ml - 160 ml
of contrast medium [23, 30, 60, 65, 68, 69, 72, 74, 85, 116, 118, 119, 123, 124] at
a contrast medium level of 300 mg iodine/ml - 400 mg iodine/ml [29, 65, 68, 82,

However, in 13 of 16 whole-body tomography protocols 100 ml - 140 ml contrast
medium is injected [30, 60, 65, 66, 68, 72, 74, 82, 113, 118, 119, 123, 124] and in
6 of 13 protocols 350 mg iodine/ml is used [29, 65, 82, 85, 123, 124]. The contrast
medium is used at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/sec. - 4.5 ml/sec. is injected [23, 30, 60,
65, 68, 74, 82, 85, 113, 118, 124]. In addition, in some clinics a post injection of
20 ml - 50 ml Ringer/- or NaCl solution with the same flow rate is used [30, 65, 66,
68, 72, 74, 85, 113, 118, 124].
The guideline of the American College of Radiology [91] recommends that 60% of
the contrast agent quantity should be injected first for venous phases in order to
carry out a split bolus protocol. With a certain delay, the remaining 40% is injected
for the arterial phase. The example of the split bolus protocol of the Royal College
of Radiologists [23] contradicts the 60 to 40 variant. First, 65 ml of contrast
medium (flow rate: 2 ml/sec) is injected, followed by 85 ml of contrast medium
(flow rate: 3.5 ml/sec). The scan starts after 60 seconds. Most hospitals have a
wide range of different protocols to achieve optimal venous and arterial imaging.
A total of 130 ml - 160 ml contrast medium is used [23, 31, 32, 60, 85, 87, 101,
116, 118, 120] with an amount of contrast medium of 300 mg iodine/ml - 400 mg
iodine/ml [60, 85, 87, 101, 116, 118]. Half of the protocols correspond to the 60 to
40 recommendation. The first contrast administration varies between 60 ml - 120
ml and the second between 40 ml - 85 ml [23, 31, 32, 80, 85, 101, 116, 118, 120].
The flow rate is between 1.5 ml/sec - 6 ml/sec [23, 31, 32, 80, 85, 116, 118, 120].
In addition, a post-injection with 30 ml - 60 ml saline flush is used [31, 32, 80, 85,
118].

Discussion
The diagnosis of the urinary tract in the polytraumatized patient requires additional
time, which may not be available in emergency care. Thus, it should be
determined in advance under which conditions a diagnosis of the urinary tract
should be carried out and it should also be decided individually whether this time
can be invested.
Different sections of the urinary tract are examined in different ways. The kidneys
and ureters are examined by means of a computer tomography scan with contrast
medium [16, 117, 126, 127, 130, 131]. The diagnostic standard for examining the
bladder is the retrograde cystography [16, 129-132] and retrograde urethrography
[16, 129-131].
The guideline S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma / Schwerverletzten-Behandlung ([16]p.212) recommends further imaging of the urinary tract in case of haematuria,
bleeding from the urethra or vagina, dysuria or local haematoma (GoR: B).
According to three cited studies (Miller, K.S. and J.W. McAninch; Peterson, N.E.
and K.A. Schulze; Richards J.R. and R.W. Derlet) by the guideline ([16]- p.209),
the diagnosis is related to the entire urinary tract, despite a 0.6% occurrence of
both upper and lower urinary tract injury. Haematuria may have its origin in both
tract sections. The other guidelines distinguish the diagnostic indications
according to the different sections of the urinary tract [126, 127, 129-132].
The kidneys and ureters are examined with a CT scan with contrast medium in
the portal venous phase and the delayed phase for targeted, further imaging in
case of indication [16, 130, 131]. The delay scan should be started at the earliest
3 - 5 minutes after the injection, but can also take place significantly later or be
repeated [23, 117, 130]. A distinction should be made between a blunt and
penetrating injury mechanism at the level of the upper abdomen to the lower
thorax [130, 131]. Hematuria is an important imaging indicator [16, 126, 127]. If a
penetrating injury is present in polytrauma patients, the examination should be
performed with or without hematuria [127, 130, 131]. According to Elliott und
McAninch, cited by the guideline S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma / SchwerverletztenBehandlung [16], a partially or completely ruptured ureter may lack hematuria.
A blunt trauma with occurring macrohaematuria is considered as an indication for
imaging [127, 130, 131]. Microhaematuria occurring alone is not sufficient for the
indication [127]. However, if haemodynamic instability is present simultaneously,
87

imaging should be performed [130, 131]. Otherwise, the patient's accident
mechanism and physical findings are an important factor [16, 130, 131]. Attention
should be paid to deceleration trauma, impact on flanks, flank pain, blunt trauma
in the region of the back or flanks, ecchymosis in the region of the flank or a rib
fracture [130, 131].
The delayed phase of the CT scan with contrast medium includes the ureters [16,
117, 126, 130, 131]. Ureter injuries are rare. The guidelines on Urological Trauma
[131] quote several studies (Pereira et al.; Elliot and McAninch; McGeady, Breyer;
Siram et al.) according to which the ureteral injury has 1 - 2.5% of urological
injuries.
An injury and further imaging of the ureters should be considered in cases of
severe abdominal or pelvic injuries, decelerating blunt trauma, penetrating trauma
of the abdomen [131] or hematuria [16]. However, haematuria is not a reliable
factor according to the EAU Guideline [131]. Imaging by intravenous pyelography
or retrograde ureteropyelography is not recommended for patients with
polytrauma who require too much time [16, 130, 131]. The bladder is further
examined for an injury using conventional cystography or CT cystography [16,
129-132]. According to Gomz et al., cited by the American Urological Association
Guideline [130], bladder injury occurs in 1.6% of blunt abdominal trauma.
Opinions differ as to whether conventional cystography or CT cystography should
be preferred. Two guidelines [130, 131] state that both examination procedures
provide the same results. However, two other guidelines [16, 128] add that CT
cystography should be preferred in acute trauma settings, especially after
previous CT scanning of the rest of the body. A single late scan may show
intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal fluid [128]. Howbeit, the fluid cannot be further
differentiated. Thus, the fluid can also be an urinoma [117, 128]. In order to
improve the diagnosis of the bladder by the representation of an extravasation, an
inserted bladder catheter should be clamped before the CT scan [23]. This
measure is not sufficient to safely exclude a bladder injury. The passive filling of
the bladder by clamping the catheter alone does not ensure that the bladder is
adequately filled during the late scan. Injuries can therefore be overlooked [128,
130, 131]. The bladder should therefore be filled with at least 300 - 350 ml or
retrogradely with diluted contrast medium up to the patient's tolerance limit [130,
131]. The indications for imaging the bladder are a penetrating trauma of the
88

lower abdomen or pelvis [128]. In addition, hematuria, especially in connection
with a pelvic fracture, is an important sign [128-131] or hematuria with a matching
injury mechanism of the bladder [129, 130].
The urethra is examined by retrograde urethrography [16, 129-131]. Men with a
pelvic fracture are mostly affected [128, 131]. Additional blood leakage from the
urethrae meatus [128, 130, 131] or dysuria supports assumption of an urethra
injury [128-130]. Before an examination of the bladder or urethra is performed, it
should be prioritised according to the presence of other injuries which a
polytrauma patient may have sincelife-threatening injuries need to be treated first
[16, 131].

Discussion
It may be necessary to adapt the standard protocol of the whole body tomography
scan from head to pelvis individually to the patient.
In most clinics the whole body tomography scan of the body ends with the
inclusion of the pelvis. The extremities are excluded from the CT scan. If,
however, there is also an injury to the extremities, a CT scan can capture them at
the same time without exposing the patient to a new scan with radiation exposure
and contrast medium [113]. In addition, the time to diagnosis can be reduced [16,
113, 137]. The extremities should be examined by a conventional two plane x-ray
or CT scan if safe or unsafe fracture signs are present [16, 136].
The condition of the patient serves as a decision parameter as to which of the two
imaging agents should be used [16]. Conventional X-rays are a good diagnostic
tool to detect fractures of the extremities [61]. Nevertheless, conventional x-ray
does not offer the possibility of imaging the vessels. In the case of a vascular
injury, an angiography [16, 113, 133, 134, 136] helps to visualize the vessels.
When deciding on a CT scan, conventional X-ray should not lead to a delay [23].
Thus the CT scan represents a fast imaging for the representation of all arteries
[16, 137].
The CT scan of the lower extremities is included in the standard protocol in some
clinics [82, 111]. In other clinics, the decision to extend the CT scan to include the
lower extremities depends on the patient's condition [74, 120]. Colip et al. [137]
and Foster et al. [113] have performed the scan of the lower limb prior to the
remaining whole-body tomography scan in their studies of limb injuries. The
extremities were presented in an arterial phase [111, 113, 120, 137]. Only in the
91

study by Schicho et al. [82] the whole body, including the lower extremities, was
scanned in the venous phase.
The inclusion of the extremities is based on the physical findings and condition of
the patient [113, 120, 133, 135, 136]. The scout can show injuries of the
extremities and be used to include them in the CT scan [74]. An important
indication for inclusion is a pulseless extremity, determined by doppler or
palpation [16, 133, 134, 136]. In this case, imaging should be performed as early
as possible [16, 137]. Especially after open fractures or luxations a perfusion
disorder may occur [113, 120, 133, 134]. Foster et al. [113] performed a CT scan
with contrast medium from the extremity in an existing hematoma, a neurological
deficit, a more proximal lying injury of the trunk and a pulsating bleeding.
In case of a penetrating trauma of the extremities, a CT scan with contrast
medium in arterial phase should also be undertaken [113, 120]. Sedlic et al. [120]
limit this to a penetrating injury up to proximal of the elbow or knee.
The CT scan can also be used to plan the surgical procedure for fractures of the
talus or scaphoid area [16, 133].
A CT scan of the extremities with contrast medium can lead to difficulties in
visualisation. An inappropriate bolus time can lead to a weakly displayed vascular
system of the extremities [113, 137]. In the study by Foster et al. [113], this
occurred in 7.7% of cases. Jöres et al. [61] examined a whole-body linear X-ray
scanner in comparison to a whole-body tomography CT scan. The extremities are
not included in the whole body tomography scan. They have dealt with fractures
of the extremities. Out of 40 detected fractures of the upper and lower extremities,
determined by X-ray examination, only 2 fractures were imaged on the initial
whole-body tomography scan. In these two cases, the whole-body tomography
scan was extended. Notably the overlooked injuries of the lower extremity were
outside the scan field. Correct positioning of the polytrauma patient was important
[61].

Another point at which the standard protocol of the CT scan can be deviated from
is the imaging of the aorta. CT angiography is appropriate as the first imaging of
the aorta [16, 108, 109, 112, 141, 142]. An advantage of CT scanning with
contrast media is fast diagnostics, widespread availability [138, 141, 142] and high
diagnostic certainty [112, 141]. However, movement artifacts may occur through
92

heart, pulse [103, 138, 139, 141] and breathing [91, 106]. Motion artifacts can
have a large negative impact on image quality [91]. To reduce the artifacts, the
examination can be performed with breathing instructions during inspiration, but
this is not always possible [91, 106]. A CT scanner with many slices and a large
detection area (≥64 slices) helps to reduce the artifacts [91]. Another technical
way to reduce motion artifacts is an ECG (electrocardiogram)-controlled
computed tomography scan [91, 103, 104, 106, 138-142]. The prospective ECGtriggered and retrospective ECG-gated CT scan provides better image quality [91,
103, 141]. Prospective ECG-triggered computed tomography enables the CT
scanner to reach the heart in its most motionless phase. The motion artifacts are
reduced [103, 104, 106, 138, 141, 142] and the risk of a false negative diagnosis
of an intima tear can be reduced [138, 141]. However, the representation of the
aorta by an inappropriate bolus time or a weak contrast agent flooding can
complicate the diagnosis [138].
There are several indications of aortic injury in the CT images. Contrast
extravasation [141, 143], intraluminary irregularities [103, 112, 141-143],
intramural hematoma [103, 138, 143], tears of the intima [103, 112, 138, 141-143]
and pseudoraneurysm [112, 141-143] are included. In addition, peraortic bleeding
[16, 112, 141] or mediastinal bleeding [16, 112, 141, 142] may be an indirect
indication.
The accident mechanism may provide evidence of blunt injury to the aorta. A
high-speed accident [16, 112, 141, 142], a fall from great heights [141, 142] or
side impact of a vehicle [16, 142] increases the risk of arotic injury.
For the explicit diagnosis of an aortic dissection, CT with contrast medium is the
imaging of choice [109, 138, 141]. The CT scan from the thorax to the pelvis is
often started with a scan lacking of contrast medium. This serves to document
calcifications of the aorta and to improve the recognition of intramural hematomas
[138, 141]. A second scan with contrast medium is then performed (at least) [111,
138, 141]. The ECG-controlled CT scan also helps with this scan to exclude
movement artefacts and to avoid false positive diagnoses, especially in the
ascending aorta [138, 141]. The reconstruction should produce very thin slices of
high quality. The imaging will detect the dissection, reveal tears of the intima,
examine the patency of the false lumen and

detect the involvement and

displacement of outgoing vessels and the occurrence of extravasation [138].
93

Another imaging protocol also used in patients with acute chest pain is the "triple
rule-out" examination [138, 141]. It serves to distinguish the causes of acute
thoracic pain with regard to acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism or
aortic dissection [138, 140, 141]. A CT with contrast medium is performed at the
time when the pulmonary arteries and the aorta can be well presented. The
pulmonary arteries are displayed on the non-ECG-gated scan and the aorta on
the ECG-gated scan [138]. However, there are some disadvantages. The
inclusion of the abdomen is not always given and thus a representation of the
aorta abdominalis is missing [138, 140]. The "triple rule-out" protocol could serve
to further differentiate acute coronary syndrome after the exclusion of a pulmonary
embolism [140]. Some authors do not recommend it as the radiation dose is
relatively high, the amount of contrast medium is higher, and aortic dissections
are not reliably visualized [138, 141].

Another situation of deviation from the standard protocol is an intestinal injury [23,
148]. Intestinal injuries are rare. Watts et al., quoted by Panda et al. [150] state
that injuries of the gastrointestinal tract occur in less than 10% of trauma patients.
In the study by Geyer et al. [148] 16 out of 375 patients (4.3%) have a large
intestine or small intestine injury or mesenteric ischemia. Panda et al. [150] quote
Khan et al., who conclude that a penetrating accident mechanism occurs more
often as a cause than a blunt mechanism. In a penetrating trauma of the abdomen
or pelvis, the Royal College of Radiologists [23] suggests the addition of oral or
rectal contrast to better detect intestinal injuries.

A whole-body tomography scan with intravenous contrast medium is usually
considered a good, sufficient diagnostic tool [17, 91, 110, 132, 148, 150]. Panda
et al. [150] have cited several studies (Brody et al; Brofman et al.; Hanks, Brody;
Kim et al.) which have listed signs of gastrointestinal tract/- or mesenteric vessel injury: free abdominal air, blood in the abdomen, individual wall thickenings, wall
irregularities, edema, contrast agent leakage, hyper- or hypodense areas, fluid
accumulation in the omentum, mesentery and/or mesocolon.
However, intestinal injuries and mesenteric ischemia may be overlooked [148].
According to four cited studies (Ghekiere et al.; Ongolo-Zogo et al.; Kim et al.; Del
Gaizo et al.) by Panda et al. [150] gastrointestinal tract injuries are more likely to
94

be overlooked in the presence of injuries to other organs. The results of the study
by Geyer et al. [148] showed that 7 injuries of the intestine within the 4.3% were
not recorded in the first written report. During a review of the first report, one of
the injuries was discovered and reported to the clinical team. The remaining six
injuries could not be detected in the CT scan even in retrospect [148].
For example, the administration of oral contrast agents can be used to assist CT
scans with intravenous contrast agents [144, 146, 149]. According to Raman and
Fishman, cited by the American College of Radiology [145], the advantage of the
oral contrast agent is that the intestinal wall can be better examined for
thickenings and contrast enhancements. A disadvantage of the oral contrast
agent is the significantly additional time required and this is therefore not always
appropriate in acute emergency situations [144, 145, 148]. In addition, it can mask
the exit of contrast medium from vessels [110, 144].
A clear statement as to whether the administration of oral contrast medium in
addition to intravenous contrast medium is better cannot be substantiated. There
is the possibility of additional assistance with oral and/or rectal contrast media [16,
23, 145, 146, 148]. This measure can be considered especially for penetrating
injuries of the abdomen and pelvis [23].

In the case of mesenteric ischemia, which, according to four cited studies (Acosta
et al.; Herbert, Stelle; Kassahun et al.; Schoots et al.) by the American College of
Radiology [145] apply to less than 1:1000 hospital admission causes, the CT scan
should include an arterial and venous phase [144, 145, 147, 149]. Yet, some
clinics add an oral contrast agent. In that third phase, the intestine is rescanned
with a delay of 50 seconds after the contrast agent is administered [144, 149]. The
possibility of an unenhanced CT scan in advance also exists. However, this does
not necessarily improve diagnostic certainty [144, 145]. According the American
College of Radiology [145] the imaging of mesenteric ischemia is difficult to
distinguish from other abdominal diseases, e.g. appendicitis, diverticulitis, acute
pancreatitis, gastroenterocolitis, cholecystitis, etc. The CT scan should be
calculated in thin slices in 2D and 3D reconstructions [144, 145, 147, 149].

In total, reading should be carried out by at least two
different radiologists, at least one of whom should be board
certified. In each case the assessment should be based on
the ABCDE scheme.
Scout assessment: The scout should be interpreted
immediately in order to triage the patient and/or adapt the
scan protocols as required.
Primary assessment: As soon as the first CT series are
available they should be evaluated immediately with the
focus on acutely relevant findings (ABCDE scheme).
Primary documentation and communication: should happen
immediately verbally and be handled adequately according
to the institutional setting and should be documented.
Secondary assessment: should also be carried out as
quickly as possible, but at least within one hour after the
primary assessment and based on the final images. Any
relevant changes to the primary assessment should be
communicated immediately and be documented.
Tertiary assessment: Should take place within 24 hours at
latest. In case of relevant changes in findings, these should
also be communicated immediately and any changes in
findings should be documented. In cases where the second
report was authorised by a Board certified Radiologist, this
should be done as an addendum.

Comments:
Reading polytrauma CT three times may seem time consuming. The consensus group
interpreted the first reading as the reading of the very first images (e.g. 1mm axial slices in soft
tissue kernel with MPR views from these data as provided automatically with first, often oral
report. This includes reading of the scout but is not limited to the scout). The second reading
means the reading of the final reconstructed images as stored in PACS (picture archiving and
communication system) with written report. In most cases, the first and second reading will be
performed by the same radiologist. Finally, the third reading should be done by a different
radiologist. For CT scans during regular working hours this may be the reading performed by an
attending radiologist (maybe in parallel with the second reading together with the radiologist who
did the first reading). For CT scans during on call periods, the third reading may be performed in
the morning of the next day. This may be the Radiologist on the next routine in-hours shift or next
on-call Radiologist. As some European countries offer Emergency Radiology as a certified
radiological subspecialty and some do not, ESER offers a European Diploma in Emergency
Radiology as an international qualification. Although desirable, ESER does not mandate such a
formal national or international Emergency Radiology qualification. Instead, ESER emphasizes
that in each case at least the second or the third reading has to be performed by a board certified
radiologist with fundamental experience in Emergency Radiology.

Discussion
We have divided the evaluation of the CT scan into several steps. We have called
these steps assessments that differ in time and environment.
The first images of the CT scan represent the scout for planning the whole-body
tomography scan. After its creation, the scout can be viewed on the CT- control
console. A quick first impression can be gained. Here the decision is made
whether immediate therapeutic measures should be taken or the CT scan should
be carried out. The guideline S3 – Leitlinie Polytrauma / SchwerverletztenBehandlung ([16]- p.300 ff.) mentions the possibility that the scout can function in
some way like a conventional X-ray image. However, this scout assessment is
supported without recommendation or evidence. The scout thus provides the
possibility to detect serious changes or injuries before the actual CT scan in the
thorax or pelvis, such as haematothoraces, pneumothoraces, dislocated pelvic
ring fractures or acetabular fractures [16]. The initial findings of the scout can be
immediately communicated orally to the Emergency Trauma Room team without
any images, so that they can initiate immediate countertherapy. In this way a
critical loss of time can be prevented [151]. It would therefore be an advantage if
at least one member of the Emergency Trauma Room team would be present
when the scout is assessed. This will provide a visual representation of the injury.
The first reading of the WBCT scan can also be performed on the extra
workstation connected to the CT control console. Here the images are
reconstructed for the first time (key issue F.2.3 Diagnostic Environment and
Communication). The evaluation of the images should take place immediately
with regard to life-threatening injuries [23, 76, 151-153]. This enables the
Emergency Trauma Room team to determine the extent of injuries at an early
stage and to take immediate and priority action against them ([16]- p.297). The
literature found, differs in the use of the findings report to the Emergency Trauma
Room team. On the one hand the report is communicated orally [76, 153], on the
other hand it is recommended to additionally record a written evaluation [23, 73].
The Royal College of Radiologists [23] offers an example form to fill in primary
assessment. This form should be completed, signed and dated. A copy will be
98

given to the Emergency Trauma Room team leader and scanned into the RIS. In
addition, the receipt of the report should be countersigned by the Emergency
Trauma Room team leader. The form contains the patient name, date of scan,
radiologist's name and telephone number, and the checklist values listed
according to the ABCDE scheme with: "Yes", "No" or "Not Available". In addition,
there is some space for free written comments. The distribution is as follows:





Including airway: Intubation, airway obstruction
Including respiration: Pneumothorax, effusion, thoracic drainage
Including circulation/bleeding: Thorax, abdominal, pelvis, soft tissues
Including neurological condition: Intracranial hemorrhage/oedema, spinal
cord injury.

This form can be seen as an orienting example for the evaluation of the CT scan
according to the ABCDE scheme [23].
The section F.2.3 Diagnostic Environment and Communication states the
possibility of printing out hard copies of the most important CT slices and thus
supporting the oral report visually. The printed images should be signed and
dated [154].
After the initial examination of the CT images, a secondary assessment should be
performed [23, 73, 76, 83, 152, 153, 155, 156]. This should be done in writing as
well as in more detail with a view not to overlook any injuries [23, 76, 83, 157,
158]. Any reconstruction of the CT scan can be evaluated at a quieter workstation
of the radiologist with access to the PACS. The result of the secondary
assessment should not take longer than 1 hour [23, 155]. In the studies, times of
60-120 min were reported [152, 153, 158, 159]. The guideline of the Royal
College of Radiologists [23] also offers a form for the secondary assessment,
which this time is based on the body regions and organs. In this case space has
been left for written explanations of the findings:

Conclusion
Responsible radiologist and contract number
Verified by [157].

The name of the patient, date, time, details of the radiologist should always be
added [23, 154]. In the case of random findings, these should be described and, if
necessary, their further follow-up recorded [38, 76, 83, 153, 154]. The random
findings occur relatively frequently in WBCT scans with 22.4% - 43.3% [76, 83,
86, 153]. The changes from the primary report that occur for example should also
be reported verbally to the trauma team in written form [23, 86, 154, 157].
A third evaluation is carried out in some studies in the tertiary assessment [86,
154, 156, 157, 160]. It is approached between the next day until 48h later [86,
156, 160]. The tertiary assessment is recorded in writing in the guideline of the
Royal College of Radiologists [23] and Briggs et al. [157] by an extra column cochecked in the second sighting. If a separate form is used for the tertiary
assessment, this may be based on the secondary assessment form. In this
fashion, changes can be detected more quickly and additional verbal information
can be transmitted by telephone [156]. This ensures that changes are not lost.
Ferree et al. [160] have made up to 12% late diagnoses due to tertiary
assessment. Injuries to the extremities are usually detected.
The study protocols provide no information on how the images are read [73, 86,
152, 156, 158-160]. The guidelines of the Royal College of Radiologists [23] and
Briggs et al. [157] suggest forms for documentation. It would be appropriate to
read out the CT scans accordingly, but no guidelines or comparative studies can
be found to confirm this. Each radiologist has developed his or her own principle.
100

Nevertheless, in the context of polytrauma patients, the ATLS principle with
ABCDE scheme has become widespread in other emergency room specialties
[16, 73, 76, 83, 152, 160]. It attempts to diagnose and treat life-threatening injuries
in a prioritised order. The whole body tomography scan serves as a possibility to
support this. Thus, in the time pressure of the scout assessment and primary
assessment, the reading or evaluation of the whole body tomography scan could
be adapted according to the ABCDE scheme. As well as that, the sequence of the
ABCDE scheme could be used to focus attention on the respective organs or CT
sections one after the other.
For example, the guideline of the Royal College of Radiologists [23] has
developed the primary assessment form according to the ABCDE scheme. More
time is available for secondary assessment, so that all organs and body sections
can now be specifically evaluated. Thus, it is also possible to examine all parts of
the body independently. The guideline of the Royal College of Radiologists [23]
and Briggs et al. [157] have thus developed their secondary assessment form.
The tertiary assessment form can be based on the secondary assessment form
with a list of body regions or organs. This is the quickest way to detect additional
findings. The most important thing, however, would be to note that a fixed protocol
or procedure is developed within the hospital for the interpretation of whole-body
tomography scans [154].
Overall, there is no evidence to determine the viewing protocol, which is why
these recommendations serve more as a rough guide.

Viergutz et al. [153] conducted a study with 1165 patients. They monitored the
findings of the whole-body tomography scan with regard to their clinical relevance
and added value in the Emergency Trauma Room. The results of the WBCT were
communicated verbally by the radiologist on site. The first group consisted of the
admission reason: "Trauma" [153], with 1038 patients. The second group
consisted of internal neurological admission reason with 127 patients. The written
findings were released within 120 minutes. 22.4% incidental findings were
reported in the trauma group. 5.2% of these findings were evaluated as clinically
relevant. In the other group there was an even greater proportion of incidental
findings, 48%, 11% of them were clinically relevant. Most incidental or non
traumatic findings occured in the head/neck area (31.9%) and consisted of
101

intracranial space requirements. Non traumatic or incidental findings were equally
frequent in the abdomen region (25%) and thorax (25%). In the written
documentation, in the letter of discharge or transfer there were usually no
references to the incidental findings. This should be regulated more clearly within
a hospital [153].
Fakler et al. [76] examined 534 patients with regard to their amount and reasons
of incidental findings in WBCT with regard to age and clinical relevance. 231
(43.3%) patients with incidental findings were divided into three categories.
Category 1 contained 36 findings of high clinical relevance. Category 2 included
48 findings of moderate clinical relevance and category 3 was made up of 147
findings of no clinical relevance. The incidental findings were mostly abdominal
(49.4%) and thoracic (20.7%). The investigation of the documentation showed
that only 52.8% of category 1 cases were documented in the discharge letters.
Only in 27.8% of these cases further diagnostics and therapy were documented.
The CT scans were analyzed acutely together by a trauma surgeon and
radiologist. The radiologist then investigated the images in detail and documented
his report. The authors came to the conclusion that many incidental findings were
uncovered by the WBCT and that every 15th patient in the collective examined
had life-threatening injuries [76].
Briggs et al. [157] have tested a new report on secondary assesment of the
WBCT in their study. The report was then faxed to the emergency room and
additionally communicated orally by telephone to the responsible physician. The
results were checked the next morning in the tertiary evaluation and, if necessary,
the patient's management item was adjusted. From 130 patients all these reports
were controlled within the study. Serious injuries were found in 35% of the
patients. Minor injuries were found in 28% of the patients. Lesions were
overlooked or underdiagnosed in 24 patients (18%). Of these, 22 findings were
not mentioned at all and in 6 cases these were severe injuries. The authors
concluded that this report is suitable for clinical use [157].
Eurin et al. [158] conducted a study with 177 patients on the topic of random
findings and their predictors in WBCT. The patients received a whole-body
tomography scan after conventional x-ray, FAST and therapy of life-threatening
injuries. The initial report was written by the radiologist within 30 - 60 minutes and
reported directly to the trauma team. 157 random findings were found in 85
102

patients. 71% of the overlooked injuries were musculoskeletal injuries and 15%
abdominal injuries. The authors concluded that second sighting is necessary as a
standard to quickly identify the overlooked injuries in the first report [158].
Smith, C.M. and S. Mason [159] surveyed 245 clinics in the UK with
questionnaires. 184 clinics completed these questionnaires. The survey reported
that most CT scans are found within 1 hour.
Ferree et al. [160] investigated delayed diagnoses of injuries by a tertiary survey
in polytrauma patients. This retrospective study included 1416 patients who were
treated according to the ATLS guidelines. Primary and Secondary Surveys were
conducted. After 24 hours the Tertiary Survey was performed. The first two
surveys were controlled, including a head to toe examination with all diagnostic
tools. If necessary, further diagnostic requirements were made. Patients who
could not respond adequately were examined later. 12% of injuries were
diagnosed late. The extremities were the most frequent cause with 78%. 35% of
these injuries had to be treated interventionally. Risk factors for a delayed
diagnosis were high-energy accidents, abdominal injuries and injuries to the
extremities. The authors concluded that a tertiary survey should be conducted
daily [160].
Muhm et al. [152] report a retrospective study with the aim to test the efficiency of
the primary and secondary survey in the emergency room. The study included
111 patients, 78 of whom received a full body computed tomography scan and 15
of whom received a CCT. The primary survey consisted of findings of the physical
examination, laboratory values in the Emergency Trauma Room, as well as FAST
imaging, conventional x-ray and immediate image evaluation of the CT scan. The
Secondary Survey consisted of the further, more detailed evaluation of the CT
images followed by a written radiological report. The patients were treated
according to the ATLS principle. The delayed diagnoses were recorded in
comparison with the discharge letters. A total of 518 diagnoses were made. In the
Primary Survey, 11% of the diagnoses were overlooked within 23% of the
patients. According to the Secondary Survey, the number of overlooked
diagnoses of 12% of the patients was 4%. The overlooked diagnoses were more
likely to occur in patients with life-threatening injuries. The ISS of these patients
was 29. The authors concluded that a Secondary Survey and a Tertiary Survey
are indispensable [152].
103

Banaste et al. [156] present a retrospective study of 2354 patients who received a
full body computed tomography scan. The CT images were evaluated a second
time by teleradiology within 24-48 hours and the results were verbally
communicated by telephone call and written report. The rate of overlooked injuries
was 12.9% and 2.5% were clinically significant. Of the 2.5% and 59 patients,
respectively, 64.4% required a change in the treatment plan. According to the first
evaluation of the CT scan, 26.6% of the patients had no injury. The random injury
rate was 2.8%. The authors concluded that patients benefit from a second
evaluation of the CT scan if they are over 30 years old, have more than two
injured body parts or a high ISS [156].
James et al. [86] describe a retrospective study on random findings in the
emergency room and their follow-up. The random findings were defined as no CT
scan abnormalities associated with the trauma and the CT images were evaluated
once after the scan and communicated directly. Evaluations were confirmed the
next day. The number of random findings was 478 (30.4%) in 1573 CT scans or
416 patients respectively. Abdomen/pelvis showed the highest proportion (61.7%)
and 97% of the incidental findings were small or clinically irrelevant findings. A
follow-up was necessary in 2.8% of the cases and only 1.4% of the random
findings was found in the discharge letter. Using the whole body tomography scan
more random findings were able to be discovered. 81.3% of the findings were
found in patients with a whole body tomography scan. The authors came to the
conclusion that better documentation and follow-up are needed for the random
findings [86].

Discussion
Interventional radiology is an important part of polytrauma care. It represents the
possibility of minimally invasive care of the polytrauma patient in addition to
conventional and surgical therapy, e.g. for active bleeding. In polytrauma care,
interventional radiology is consulted on call for certain findings in the CT scan
[23]. For interventional radiology there are many own societies, which have a
correspondingly high special expertise [161, 162]. Thus, at this point, reference
should be made to the recommendations of the Societies for Interventional
Radiology. We concur with these recommendations.

Within the framework of radiological polytrauma

should be maintained as institutional standards. One
should be optimized with regard to radiation dose yielding
high diagnostic validity but prioritising lower radiation

Comments:
It has been proven that the maintenance of a protocol standard for whole-body CT after
polytrauma increases the probability of survival (Huber-Wagner et al. [163]). As a possible
consequence of this fact, the experts at the conference observed an increase in Emergency
Trauma Room admissions who subsequently receive a WBCT. In parallel, the ESER experts
share the impression that the number of patients with minor injuries who undergo WBCT has
also increased. The consensus group concluded that a single standard protocol can rarely do
justice to this varied situation. A more refined but nevertheless simple differentiation would be
desirable with regard to the essential influencing parameters: Injury severity, patient condition,
patient age including the probability of relevant comorbidities and/or medication, dose aspects
especially with regard to patient age. The other previous recommendations remain unaffected.

Discussion
No literature research has been carried out on this chapter. Instead, a
summarizing evaluation of the literature mentioned so far was carried out, also
taking into account previous statements. The aim is to propose the use of wholebody tomography in the clinical routine of emergency rooms.

106

In the literature research of the other topics, studies have been found which deal
with the performance of whole-body tomography scans. The topics of the studies
often dealt with the time management of the WBCT scan [24, 29, 66], the
radiation exposure [29, 30, 32, 67, 73, 85] and image quality [31, 32, 69] or rather
the diagnostic safety [80, 83]. Many studies have looked for indications to perform
a whole-body tomography scan. Depending on physiology, injury pattern or
accident mechanism, either a whole body tomography scan or a selective CT
scan was performed [17-19]. This enables an adapted imaging to the individual
polytrauma patient.
Reske et al. [74] have gone one step further. In the retrospective study with 308
patients, the introduction of two new whole-body tomography protocols was
examined. They compared various protocols to each other: an old whole-body
tomography protocol and two new protocols. Reske et al. [74] have added two
new protocols to replace the initial protocol (“One-fits-all-concept” ([74]- p.1142))
with a single WBCT protocol for each adult polytrauma patient. In the new
concept, one of the two possible WBCT protocols was individually selected for the
polytrauma patient according to certain criteria. The "OLD protocol" ([74]- p.1141)
(group O) and the “TIME protocol“ ([74]- p.1141) (group T) had the same
structure. They consisted of a scout of the whole body followed by an unenhanced
scan of the head and neck. The scan of the rest of the body was performed with a
delay of 60 seconds after the application of the contrast medium. The arms were
positioned, unchanged on the trunk during the entire CT scan. In group T,
however, revised automatic exposure systems were used. The "DOSE protocol"
([74]- p.1141) (group D) divided the scout into the head/neck and the rest of the
body. The CT scan of this region was performed according to the scout of the
head/neck. Then the arms were raised above the head and the second scout was
made. The scan of the rest of the body was performed after a time delay of 60
seconds after application of the contrast medium. The head and neck were
examined in all protocols with the same protocol parameters and the protocol
parameters of the rest of the body were also the same in group T and group D.
The remaining body was then examined with the same protocol parameters. The
overlapping of the individual segmented scan areas are prevented in the two new
protocols. The protocol of group D was structured in such a way that the radiation
exposure for the polytrauma patient was as low as possible. The protocol of group
107

T was designed with the requirements of the shortest possible duration in mind,
but with compromises in image quality and radiation dose.
The decision process for using the "DOSE protocol“ ([74]- p.1141) or “TIME
protocol“ ([74]- p.1141) included several points. First, the clinical condition of the
patient, with respect to vital signs or hemodynamic stability, and the suspicion of a
life-threatening injury, was a key decision factor. If one of the two points was
fulfilled, the “TIME protocol" ([74]- p.1141) is immediately carried out. Also, if none
of the two points above was present, the possibility of arm elevation was checked.
If there was an injury that prevents arm elevation, the “TIME protocol" ([74]p.1141) was carried out. Otherwise, the “DOSE protocol" ([74]- p.1141) was
performed with both or only one raised arm.
The determined examination time resulted in 6-10 minutes for group D, 2.8-7.2
minutes for group T and 3.3-5.6 minutes for group O. The image noise in group D
was significantly lower. They achieved to reduce the effective radiation by
approximately 7 mSv using the protocol of group D (group D = 28.2 mSv) in
comparison with group T (group T = 35.4 mSv).
The authors came to the conclusion that the double-track whole-body tomography
protocol concept is superior to the "One-fits-all-concept" ([74]- p.1142). In
addition, the CT protocols should be continuously monitored and, if necessary,
improved, because the CT technology is constantly being further developed.

ESER would endorses abandoning a "One-fits-all-concept" ([74]- p.1142).
Instead,

ESER

recommends

to

introducing

a

double-track

whole-body

tomography protocol concept with a ‘Dose Protocol’ and a ‘Time/Precision
Protocol’. Obviously, the choice between the two variants should be based on the
individual clinical presentation and vital parameters of the polytrauma patient (for
more information, see section F.1 Polytrauma classification).
The ‘Dose Protocol’ should be designed in such a way that the patient is exposed
to the lowest possible radiation exposure despite sufficient image quality in order
to ensure a reliable diagnosis of injuries (often young and stable patients with
dramatic injury history and a GCS = 15). A dose far below 20 m Sv should be
aimed for. A good potential ‘Dose Protocol’ may consist of an unenhanced head
scan, low dose CT of the midface/ neck/ cervical spine (with or without contrast
enhancement), elevation of the arms, scout of the trunk, and a single pass scan of
108

chest/ abdomen and pelvis using a split bolus injection protocol with a resulting
arterial/venous mixed contrast of all vessels and organs. For this protocol, the
arms should be moved above the head in order to additionally reduce the
radiation dose (section F.5.2 Arm position). In (few) cases where a ‘Dose
Protocol’ scan leaves potentially important findings unclear, another CT scan
should be performed accordingly.
In contrast, the ‘Time/Precision Protocol’ is optimised for very fast, very high
diagnostic accuracy and will more or less correspond to the institutional protocol
used so far. This protocol should include diagnostic certainty for the detection of
life-threatening injuries, by means of comprehensive diagnostics. In this protocol,
the arms are to be placed on the trunk in order to save the time of an elevation. A
whole body tomography scan, consisting of several phases, can offer added value
for diagnostic. The time elapsing between the arterial and venous phases can
show a progressive change in the contrast medium or an occurring extravasation.
This can be an important diagnostic indication for injury differentiation [116-118].
The key advantage is the more sensitive detection of active bleeding [16, 23, 115,
116].
The assignment of the polytrauma patient to one of the two protocols is shown in
figure 3.

Figure 3. Decision guidance for polytrauma CT imaging.
First, a potential polytrauma patient should be re-evaluated in the Emergency Trauma Room
whether the criteria for a classification as polytrauma (table 2) is given. If so, and in the case of a
severe clinical presentation with life-threatening injuries and/or hemodynamic instability, the
polytrauma ‘Time/Precision Protocol’ (whole-body CT (WBCT) variant A) is applied. If the patient is
also classed as polytrauma but does not fulfil criteria for MDCT protocol variant A, the ‘Dose
Protocol’ (WBCT variant B) may be used. Otherwise, the patient should receive imaging like other
emergency patients.

Funding
No funding was available during the development of the whole ESER-Guideline
process. In the future ESER may aim to reach funding from companies. If such a
funding should arise in the future, this would reach ESER but not particular
authors and ESER declares that such a funding income would be spent on
educational purposes like free publication of the Guideline via the ESER
homepage or at congress meetings, support of the EDiR diploma or educational
parts of ESER congress meetings.

Authors' contributions
The former ESER President (SW) was instructed by the ESER Board to divide the
entire field of radiological polytrauma care into individual sections. Parts of the
project were assigned to JH at the Ludwig-Maximilian-University as a basis for his
doctoral thesis.
SW and JH were responsible for preparing information for each of these sections
on the basis of current literature and experience. Together, SW and JH
determined the search key words according to respective ‘sections’ and related
‘key issue’ and performed the literature search. SW and JH also classified the
literature and suggested topics and key questions. They suggested a first possible
statement and recommendation grade (GoR/GPP) considering the respective
evidence level. In case of a GPP statement, the respective level was suggested
by SW. Except MD, all authors participated at the consensus conferences (JH
without voting right). Using the literature found, JH prepared the discussions of
each section. Together, SW and JH prepared the manuscript and SW distributed
it to all authors. SW collected the feedbacks and together with JH, MD and ED
they created the final manuscript version which was read and approved by every
author. SW and JH contributed equally and share the first authorship.

Acknowledgements
The Guideline on Radiological Polytrauma Imaging and Service is published
simultaneously in a full version (this article) and a short version (open access
publication in ’Insights into Imaging’ [1]). This causes text overlap between the two
versions. We mention this to avoid a potential conflict with respect to selfplagiarism. ESER wants to thank Ricarda Posch and Wolfgang Duchek (both
112

ESER office) as well as Sabine Grab (former secretary of SW) for their
organisational support. ESER also wants to thank Maureen Dumba for her
enormous encouragement on behalf of ESER in social media.
